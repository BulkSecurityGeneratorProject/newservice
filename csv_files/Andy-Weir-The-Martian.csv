4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RKMO449VT48H3?ASIN=1491590173	4.7573214851 Stars	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I'm a hard-science science fiction fan and would rather read hard sc-fi than almost anything. I love stories and movies about Mars, and I'm a fan of survival, castaway, and man-against-the elements stories. I loved Robinson Crusoe, so it should not surprise you that I loved the movie, Robinson Crusoe on Mars. I realize it's not Academy Award material, but to me, it's everything I want it to be, as was this book, The Martian.<br/><br/>The main character, Watney, presumed dead, is accidentally left by his crew mates when an intense Martian dust storm forces them to abort their mission. What follows for part of the book is a logbook style narrative that describes in great technical detail Watney's efforts to extend his life until the next scheduled mission arrives in 4 years. After reading just the first 20% of the book (my Kindle has no page numbers) one can't help but be impressed by the author's depth of knowledge in this regard. In fact, the entire book is an astronaut's primer on extraterrestrial and deep space survival and rescue.<br/><br/>The Martian isn't without its typos and editorial glitches, and I'm not sure if this was a result of a bad Kindle conversion or just a shortsighted editor. For me, though, typos and editing issues paled in comparison to the snowballing storyline, which I gladly admit is not for everyone.<br/><br/>This is not a touchy-feely book about love, romance or relationships. There is no overpowering angle between characters. No good guys in white hats and bad guys in black hats. There's no room for cliches. It's all very business like and scientific. So, if you're looking for Twilight in Space. Or Fifty Shades of Mars. Or Tom Hanks making himself a friend by drawing a face on a soccer ball, you'll probably want to skip this one. This book is simply about the mission, and the cold reality of working hard to turn a wrong into a right.<br/><br/>Another thing you won't find in this book is a lot of heartfelt reminiscing or reflection. There are no flashbacks of our main character fishing with Dad at the old water hole, or him riding his first bicycle without training wheels. This is a book about a guy with a keen intellect surviving on a hostile planet and doing so by making the most out of a given set of resources.<br/><br/>About a third of the way through the book, the author adds third person narratives from mission control and the Hermes space craft, the latter manned by the crew that left our hero behind -- and make no mistake, hero is the operative word. Again, we don't follow our mission control cast of characters back too their respective homes and meet their wives and husbands and get served up cliche insights into their innermost thoughts. Blech! I hate those stories! Which doesn't mean these characters are cookie cutter or superficial. On the contrary, I found the characters sufficiently individuated and interesting.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book to people who are into reading hard sci-fi of the not-too-distant future, sci-fi without blasters and ray guns or 9' tall aliens that bleed acid. (Btw, I like those stories, too, but good ones are hard to find.)<br/><br/>Somebody did their homework on this one -- and that's what stands out above all else.</span>"

Everyone thinks I'm dead. I'm in a Hab designed to last 31 days. If the Oxygenator breaks down, I'll suffocate. If the Water Reclaimer breaks down, I'll die of thirst. If the Hab breaches, I'll just kind of explode. If none of those things happen, I'll eventually run out of food and starve to death. So yeah. I'm f----d."" - Mark Watney<br/><br/>As the two-hundred thirty-fourth reader to review THE MARTIAN by Andy Weir, I have no illusion that I can add anything substantive to the plaudits already heaped on this intelligent work of space sci-fi. Simply put, it's a nail-biter that'll trim your finger nail plates down even with the nail beds.<br/><br/>My reading tastes usually don't encompass space fiction because the vast majority of it seems to fall within the realm of extreme fantasy with worlds and ETs of the most fantastical sorts. I prefer my off-Earth stories to have some plausible connection with realistic, albeit extrapolated, technology and situations, and the one book that remains embedded in my memory as simply terrific is from all the way back in 1975 when I was much younger and perhaps more impressionable - Arthur C. Clarke's <a class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rendezvous-with-Rama/dp/0899684491"">Rendezvous with Rama</a>. With films, I'm the same way; <a class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outland/dp/B001R1DZ4Y"">Outland</a> and <a class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-Running/dp/B000063UR1"">Silent Running</a> come to mind. THE MARTIAN is my kind of SF.<br/><br/>In Mars mission engineer-botanist Mark Watney we have a thinking man's hero for the ages, and THE MARTIAN is a story that cries out to be serialized for television.<br/><br/>THE MARTIAN would be ideal for a lengthy trans-ocean plane flight. If you start the book on take-off, you'll likely finish on landing and not even be aware of the hours that passed or the screaming kid a couple of rows back.<br/><br/>You owe yourself this novel. Trust me.</span>"
4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1TC15NPCF9GMW?ASIN=1491590173	Abandoned on Mars	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">A futuristic Robinson Crusoe! Due to a dust storm, Mark Watney is left for dead in the Acidalia region of Mars when the Ares 3 mission is aborted 6 days into the scheduled two months. What follows is largely a logbook of living in a large tent or a small rover for about 550 days on what was supposed to be two month's rations for 6 people. Fortunately there were some potatoes for thanksgiving that were alive, so Mark starts dividing them and growing them. But first he has to make soil, and then water, and so on. Generally speaking, a logbook is a poor technique, but here it is brilliant. You cannot have conversation, and you cannot develop other characters, but did I mention he was abandoned? Alone? You might still think that 550 days stuck in a tent or rover could get boring, but no, this book is absolutely gripping.<br/><br/>Watney was resourceful, and the book is very good at showing the scientific approach to problems, putting numbers to them, and showing what happens if you do what, so in a sense it is also a book of puzzles: this has gone wrong, how can it be fixed? Tension is maintained well because Watney has an unseen companion: Murphy. If it can go wrong, it does, sometimes because of Watney's own lack of knowledge. To make water, first he makes hydrogen. This is not a good idea, and Watney finds out why. Because I have also written a book centred on Mars, I know the author has really spent a lot of time understanding the nature of Mars, and this book shows quite well what being on the surface of Mars would be like. There is the odd error, probably intentional for effect, for example the effects of the dust storm are too great. Martian winds can hit up to 200 k/h, but gas pressures are about 1% of Earth's, so, after correcting for the lower gravitational acceleration and the mass of dust, the forces will still be only a few percent of those of comparable wind velocities on Earth. That, however, is forgiven, because if the author were strictly correct on this, then there would be no story.<br/><br/>To summarize, this is a surprisingly gripping story of survival against all the odds, and I strongly recommend it.<br/><br/>Ian Miller, author of Red Gold.</span>"

5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R32NNLGY7QGRVJ?ASIN=1491590173	Inventive, humorous, tedious	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This is in some ways a delightful book.  It's incredibly detailed in its technical aspects, and the inventiveness of the hero is quite wonderful to watch.  There's a continual vein of sardonic humor running through, and a nice sense of suspense at the cascading disasters that occur.<br/><br/>That said, this is a nerd's book.  It is driven almost entirely by the mastery of technical details, which are set forth more like engineering term papers (wait, were there even papers in Engineering?  I was an English major...) than story narrative. There is a modicum of  fairly one-dimensional characterization layered on top of it, and a plot that consists of an almost predictable chain of catastrophes.  It fits a small niche of technically-driven science fiction but lacks any of the breadth and depth of much of the genre.<br/><br/>I'm fascinated by the mass of 5-star reviews, given that (a) this is a book that appeals primarily to our technical side and (b) sic-fi reviewers are by and large a pretty critical lot.  Interesting.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R14NNZV8RFYM5K?ASIN=1491590173	Cool science and tech...but no life on Mars	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">The Martian has all the right elements for a classic adventure tale:  a modern day ""shipwrecked"" explorer with limited resources but lots of ingenuity and technical know-how, fighting for survival in a dangerous environment. The level of scientific and engineering detail fills the narrative with a vivid sense of realism. At first glance, it reminded me of Robert A. Heinlein's hard scifi stories, so I was pretty excited about reading it.<br/><br/>The first few pages reeled me right in, but the more I read of The Martian, the less I enjoyed it. I like hard scifi, so I was expecting The Martian to be heavier on the science than on character development. When a novelist puts characters in life-or-death situations though, I do expect him to flesh those characters out at least enough to interest me in their fate.  The people in this book are so very flat and undeveloped that they never even come to life.<br/><br/>The novel is mostly journal entries written by the main character, astronaut Mark Watley.  Given that he &amp; his crewmates lived together in a spaceship for months on end, seems he'd have something interesting to relate about them (and himself). Instead, the reader hears who is The Hot One, who is The Religious One, who loves disco and who hates it.<br/><br/>What finally ruined the book for me is the author's sloppy approach to writing dialogue, particularly Watley's. As a protagonist, he's inventive, intelligent and persistent, while still human enough to make mistakes. His situation predisposes the reader to like him, or at least root for him. Unfortunately, the author writes such clumsy dialogue that Watley often sounds annoying if not outright obnoxious. Human qualities, yes, but not good ones for your main character to exhibit. I guess the author pictured Watley as an amusing, cheeky rogue. Instead, he comes across as irritatingly juvenile...I almost expected him to start telling knock-knock jokes.<br/><br/>I hope this author continues to write; he's got the ""science"" part of SF mastered, though the fiction aspect still needs work. He does a good job with action, and the ""stranded on Mars"" scenario itself is fascinating to imagine. But when the characters aren't interesting or engaging, what should have been an exciting story becomes an increasingly monotonous account of what broke and what got fixed.</span>"

I buy a lot of indie sci-fi from the Kindle Store, and most of it is poorly edited and utterly bereft of anything remotely approaching a plot. I came across this I don't know how, and figured ""well, 99 cents, I can't really lose."" This is quite possibly my new favorite sci-fi book of all time. It is written in the style of George Alec Effinger's Budayeen books, with an irreverent 1st person style, occasionally dropping in to 3rd person for various scenes. As thick with the info-dump as a Neal Stephenson novel, but without the massive digressions. There's a hero, he overcomes obstacles (to put it mildly), and an exciting finish. Well written, well edited, fast-paced. All in all, if there were like 500 stars to click, I'd click 'em.</span>"

My fellow author is a professor of mechanical engineering, and had to make a student of me before I could process his ideas into English.  The protagonist's survival in ""The Martian"" depends largely on his McGiver-ish ability to use creatively his knowledge of mechanical engineering.  I really enjoyed seeing concepts of physics take on vivid meaning in this suspenseful context.  I'm looking forward to seeing the movie version.</span>"
4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2KGXDJXB12QET?ASIN=1491590173	Set phasers to cringe	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Andy Weir's mind-bending short story The Egg was my introduction to his work. Available to read for free on his website as of this writing, it explores the aftermath of a car crash, and demonstrates Weir's spare, but deep and engaging writing style. Recently, while discussing Chris Nolan's Interstellar among friends, I heard Weir had a new book out when someone mentioned Ridley Scott would be adapting The Martian for film. With how much I enjoyed these other works and their respective messages about humanity, I was ready to dive in to Weir's debut novel, expecting greatness. But it isn't there. Where Interstellar or The Egg are deeply emotional, human stories, equal parts introspection and cosmic pilgrimage, The Martian is the inexplicably cheerful diary of a know-it-all, describing his efforts to return to his home in the comments section of reddit.<br/><br/>Due to an accident during a Martian sandstorm in which he is presumed killed, fellow astronauts maroon the narrator, botanist and engineer Mark Watney, on the Red Planet. He is forced to survive in a small space, without contact with other humans, for years. His friends left and took the radio. If the food doesn't run out first, the water or oxygen will. The situation is, as he implies in the opening lines, quite dire. As a reader: okay. So far, so good. The obvious question is, ""What type of rugged techie survivalist is Watney? What is he going to do to get out of this?"" Turns out that he was the ""comic relief"" of his crew--less Jack London or Liam Neeson, more Bozo the Astronaut or MacGyver in a propeller hat.<br/><br/>Maybe it's the bad TV and music he consumes which makes Watney's log entries, which comprise most of the book, read like +1000 comments on reddit, but never mind the cause. To anyone outside of that culture, it's insufferable.<br/><br/>To clarify, I am not at all opposed to hard science fiction, technical jargon, or research. Getting some technical bits right while you make stuff up is important, as Weir, son of a particle physicist, surely knows. Apollo 13 could have been a tragedy, but technical badasses on both ends averted it. Using science and gumption to save yourself from dying on an inhospitable alien planet is BAD ASS. The problem is, to paraphrase Carl Sagan, ""They should have sent a poet... not this dweeb."" I don't know what kind of device he's writing these log entries on, but Watney's phraser is a semi-auto loaded with exclamation points (yay!)! His jokes are regrettable and cringeworthy coming from an adult man (bwa ha ha!)! They might be why his crew actually left him on Mars.<br/><br/>Such stumbling could be forgiven if the rest of the story and characters were compelling, but they aren't. There are cool swashbuckling ideas, like re-purposing old probes for survival, or using a nuke as a space heater to save electricity, but in execution, the adventure of it all is buried under an avalanche of facts and figures. In serious mode, Watney sucks the suspense and life from the narrative by writing it in the style of instructions for putting together a piece of furniture. Even scenes which involve playing with rocket fuel are marred by tedium. Maybe it's all some kind of ironic meta-commentary on the ill effects of staying shut indoors away from people for extended periods: you become euphoric about chemistry equations and poop jokes. Again, though, it's terrible.<br/><br/>Most of all, The Martian needs some genuine danger, damn it. For being stranded and alone in a freezing, rusted desert tens of millions of miles away from civilization, Watney comes across as remarkably comfortable and unconcerned. Whatever the environment throws at him, he has an answer. His mistakes are trivial and few, so one never worries that he won't survive. Aside from almost blowing himself up and being alone, the greatest adversities he faces in the first third of the novel are an uncomfortable car seat, unswept solar panels, and disco music. At one point, he needs to load solar panels onto the roof of his rover, but they weigh quite a bit even with lower Martian gravity. ""Uh oh,"" the experienced sf reader might think, ""I know where this is headed. He's going to break a panel and screw himself over!"" Nah. He rigs something up and instantly the artificial problem is solved. It's almost a footnote in his log, as if it didn't exist to begin with. This is a recurring theme.<br/><br/>The Martian is a disappointment, less of a novel and more of an overlong blog post infused with the stink of edutainment, and not even the fun Oregon Trail kind. Again, there is nothing wrong with learning cool science things--I encourage doing so--but in a novel, this should come second to learning about the characters and their struggles. To The Martian, the opposite is true. Or maybe I just hate Mark Watney and wish there could have been a character building, Cast Away dentistry scene.<br/><br/>(I still have hopes for the movie adaptation. It could outshine the book if it nixes Watney's narration.)</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2IP6ZVS4W46VH?ASIN=1491590173	Robinson Crusoe on Mars:  Hard SciFi at its best!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Self published books on Amazon are often a crap-shoot.  You read through piles of drek that should never have been published in hope of finding one good book.<br/><br/>This is that book. It is, by far, the best Hard Science Fiction book I've read in years.  In The Martian, Astronaut Mark Watney is accidentally left for dead by his crewmates during a fierce storm.  Marooned on Mars, he has to use his intelligence and wit to survive and wait for a rescue ship, which at best would be over a year away.  The majority of the book is in a 'Log' format, with the main character chronicling what happened during each day.  Periodically the book cuts from the logbook format to a traditional narrative for the supporting characters in space and on Earth.<br/><br/>This is very difficult format to write, but the author manages to pull it off masterfully.  As the main character recounts his triumphs and tragedies you can't help but be dragged into his struggle against the unforgiving Martian environment.  I never thought it would be possible to be kept up past my bedtime by story that involved a man trying to grow potatoes inside an inflatable tent.  The tension and drama are interspersed, where appropriate, by humor and wit.  A good example is when Mark realizes that by growing potatoes he has met the requirements for colonizing Mars (""Take that, Niel Armstrong!"").<br/><br/>The author did his homework and it shows.  The science is top notch and well researched.  The only obvious scientific inaccuracy I found was that the effects of a Martian storm were stronger than they are in real life by an order of magnitude.  This is acceptable as without the storm, Mark would not have been abandoned and the story couldn't happen.  The author manages to describe exceptionally complex engineering and chemical processes in a way that is both entertaining and understandable to the layman.<br/><br/>Andy Weir managed to masterfully capture the spirit of NASA during its glory days, when there was no obstacle that could not be solved by an engineer with a slid rule, roll of duct tape, and a dash of creativity.<br/><br/>I bought the Kindle edition, but I hope someday it will be released in paper form.  The hard cover has a place on my bookshelf next to Heinlein, Clarke, and Asimov.</span>"
2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1II5CWZYQ6CQB?ASIN=1491590173	This reboot of Robinson Crusoe is ingenious but flawed.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I understand the 5-star reviews  -- but I can only give The Martian 3.<br/><br/>To his immense credit, Andy Weir has re-invented Daniel Defoe's terrifically popular 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe and turned it into a nerd's fantasy of engineering competency. This is a huge achievement, and yet it is flawed.<br/><br/>Robinson Crusoe dealt with a shipwrecked sailor's survival narrative, and The Martian is likewise at core a survival narrative.  Survival forms the core tension for novels as diverse as Lord of The Flies, Hatchet, The Hunger Games, Flight of The Phoenix, and Jurassic Park.  The varying literary quality can range from young adult (Hatchet) to the serious literary concerns of Lord Of The Flies.<br/><br/>In the case of The Martian, Weir invented his own genre (another considerable achievement, maybe worth 5 stars alone.) Call it the uber-engineering problem-solver technology puzzle survival narrative. This structure of creating problems (puzzles) to be solved in order for the hero to survive and then having the hero solve them is gratifying and fun. You hope to God that if you were stranded on Mars, you'd be as smart as Weir's astronaut hero and figure out such crazy, clever inventive solutions. This problem solving structure, a strength of the book - is also a weakness, because 90% of the plot goes like this:<br/><br/>1. Astronaut Mark Watney meets technical problem A, solves with clever solution B.<br/>2. Astronaut Mark Watney meets technical problem C, solves with clever solution D.<br/>3. Astronaut Mark Watney meets technical problem E, solves with clever solution F.<br/>4.  REPEAT, REPEAT, REPEAT<br/><br/>This novel argues a deep faith in human reason and hard work to solve any problem, and that reveals a naïve core.  Because the book never strays far from the technical details to investigate any of the bigger problems that more serious science fiction might address.<br/><br/>(Aside:) I was at a presentation at the Rand corporation where the engineers present demonstrated crazy hubris in their ability to solve global warming. Their attitude: ""Don't worry, if climate gets really bad we'll write some code - that's what we do.""<br/><br/>Still, if you are going to write hard science fiction, it's easy to get trapped within the known limits of technology. And one of the things Weir does well is to poke into every corner of the known. I am sure he had fun researching this book, and learning details about the battery that went into the 1997 Pathfinder probe. There are limits to that kind of convincing detail, because while readers want that, they also want to connect with the human factor, and interesting complex characters.<br/><br/>Astronaut Mark Watney's log feels believably written because his entries are composed like you'd expect a guy with an engineering degree to write. This is not a slight at guys with engineering degrees (Norman Mailer studied engineering for awhile.) But engineers are typically less interested in stylist prose than cool engineering details. Any lack of style on Weir's part actually adds to the credibility of his hero Watney's log. And Watney, he is exactly what we have been told astronauts are like: brilliant, cheerful, can-do and tireless. Another writer might have aired Watney's depressive doubts or discussed his futile sex life on Mars, but Weir stays in ""the clean room."" Watney is iconic, a can-do American engineer and farmer. He can even farm Mars, no problem. This book celebrates our belief in that mythic hero, the American astronaut, no doubt a strong part of it's appeal. Possibly, if there is an emotional connection and an emotional core to the book it is here. We wish people like American Astronaut Mark Watney existed and if they did we would happily root for their survival. Likely, the readers that love this book are responding to that note.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you are an engineer, you will love this book because it confirms everything about life that ever made you want to be an engineer. But if you are not an engineer, but are just interested in reading the best of imaginative hard science fiction there are better books. Books that engage bigger questions and open worlds of wonder and philosophical inquiry.<br/><br/>Here are a few:<br/><br/>Rendezvous With Rama (Arthur C. Clarke)<br/>Foundation (Isaac Asimov)<br/>Ringworld (Larry Niven)<br/>Revelation Space (Alastair Reynolds)<br/>The Forever War (Joe Haldeman)<br/>Spin (Robert Charles Wilson)<br/>Contact (Carl Sagan)<br/>Downbelow Station (C. J. Cherryh)<br/>Red Mars (Kim Stanley Robinson)<br/>The Diamond Age (Neal Stephenson)</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1WGZ1X7GH2SUU?ASIN=1491590173	Most weakly developed characters I've ever read.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I honestly can't believe the number of 5-star reviews for this book.<br/><br/>And, I'm no ""literary snob,"" I just expect a couple of basic things from a novel, even a ""light read"" like this: an engaging plot (which is the strength of this book) and well-developed characters who I actually care about (which is its huge, glaring weakness).<br/><br/>I say this without a hint of hyperbole: these are the most weakly developed characters I have ever read. I literally know almost nothing about ANY of the characters besides brief, very shallow initial descriptions, and whatever I could gather from their very science-heavy interactions. I mean, it's crazy how little we know about the main character, Mark, considering we have plenty of time to get to know him: we're trapped on Mars with him for more than a year! I challenge one of the 5-star reviewers to tell me something about Mark, besides ""He is funny"" and ""He is clever."" I honestly thought that maybe a big plot twist was going to be that Mark was a robot.<br/><br/>Think of how much better this book could have been if we had learned anything about Mark's life, his goals/desires, even his inner feelings about being trapped. Does he have someone special waiting for him back on earth? A kid? How are his parents feeling - and how does he feel toward them? Maybe he develops a relationship with someone on board the ship? Does he ever have dark days of depression? Just give me something to grab on to! I mean, if you think about it, even an oft-mocked book like ""Twilight"" could be considered a better novel; at least the characters are developed to the point where they seem like actual human beings (or vampires/werewolves, as it were), instead of cardboard cutouts.<br/><br/>The consequence of this weak development is that I didn't care what happened to any of these people. Mark could have blown himself up and I would have said, ""Eh."" This ends up reading like a technical manual for escaping mars - or some kind of solve-the-puzzle book - not an actual novel. If/when this is made into a movie, screenwriters will have to create an entire backstory for every single character, otherwise nobody will watch it.<br/><br/>The sad part is, the plot IS pretty good. There's always some new problem cropping up and Mark figuring out some clever way to solve it. I don't even mind the VERY detailed scientific explanations of everything (yes, everything.) They just need to be balanced out a bit.<br/><br/>Overall, a very hollow disappointment.</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2282G46TE2AAS?ASIN=1491590173	Keeping it Real	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">They say don’t judge a book by it’s cover, because the judgments can prove to be false wrongly guide you perspective, but it’s inevitable. My literal first judgments of The Martian’s cover proved true, unfortunately.<br/><br/>If prompted to think of cover imagery for a novel titled “The Martian”, what appears? It most likely contains the red sandy atmosphere of mars, and an astronaut planted within the familiar atmosphere; communicating the overarching plot(s) of the novel. It can be pretty well assured that response would be in the majority. If a majority can anticipate how something will be with minute briefing it is not because they are incredibly deductive thinkers, it is more likely that the imagery is riddled with cliché and predictability. The predictability of the cover foreshadows the nature of the plot and characters of Andy Weir’s The Martian.<br/><br/>The plot, character’s, format, and theme are exactly what one would expect from looking at the cover. A man trapped in space with no communication who must face impossible circumstances to find a way back to Earth. The cliché of the genre, which this novel is heavily imbedded, presents immense opportunities for plot twists and cliffhangers; sadly the author took every opportunity presented to him, keeping comfortably within the framework. With the close frequency of the minor twists and turns even those became predictable and soon lost the intended impact.<br/><br/>We understand Weir’s intention to keep the reader’s attention engaged, but other methods, with maybe an artistic (low gravity) leap the novel would have brought about something new and exciting. Perhaps by removing a majority of the minor twists and instead having a handful of big plot twists The Martian would diverge from the predictable a be a 12g force of writing to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>While originality is lacking, the one thing that sets this novel apart is the amount of sarcasm, lamp shading, and smartass-ery. Mark Watney, a.k.a. The Martian is one to cope with things through humor and sarcasm and thanks to that Weir’s novel is riddled with hilarious remarks throughout. Many times throughout one can be sure to find themselves laughing out loud (literally) as Watney deals with every issue thrown at him, which when trapped on Mars for almost a year there is more than a few. Besides humor the next present element is math. With many of us not being astro-botanists a lot of the math, and science, goes over our heads, but whether we fully understand it or not makes no difference on it’s validity.<br/><br/>The realistic science and math paired with the uncharacteristic witty smartass of a main character The Martian definitely has something going for it that momentarily has the potential to overshadow the unoriginality of the plot.<br/><br/>The Martian is in it’s most basic form is a mix-mash of Ray Bradbury’s The Martian Chronicles embedded with the reality and modernism of the hit films Gravity and Apollo 13. With it’s light-hearted take on an astronaut being stuck on Mars Weir’s novel is a fun read for anyone who had dreams of being an astronaut when they were little. An essential beach read for Dad’s who don’t want anything too serious.

3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3J2LQ2DDK6SQ6?ASIN=1491590173	A stripped-down survival story, all science and little psychological depth, still lots of fun	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">The Martian is a solid book that hits all the sweet spots to get your adrenalin pumping. What could be more compelling than watching our hero-astronaut Mark Watney, left for dead on Mars, try to figure out how to stay alive on the barren red planet and get home. The book alternates between Watney's logs, which are full of snark, some atonally childish (he says ""Yay!"" a lot, seriously really?), some witty and genuinely laugh-out-loud funny; his shipmates on the Hermes, who were forced to abandon him; and the NASA team who try to figure out how to get Watney home when they realize he's still alive, going from Plan A to B to a desperate, go-for-broke C during the course of the book.<br/><br/>Science wonderfully permeates this book and Andy Weir doesn't spare us the dry technical details. Since the whizz-bang calculations are coming out of the mouths of self-deprecating, potty-mouthed scientists and space geniuses, it all feels light and readable. It won't trip you up unless you have a serious aversion to science or lack basic science literacy. (And if you do, you shouldn't have picked up this book in the first place! Get out of here.)<br/><br/>And still… something was lacking. This could have been a really terrifying book, the ultimate portrait of survival, but Weir does away with any extraneous psychological exploration, and the characters all end up like the stripped down vehicles and machines our stranded astronaut tinkers with on Mars to keep his shelter running.<br/><br/>Mark Watney never despairs, he stays level-headed, and even when all things go to hell, he keeps his sense of humor. He's down on Mars for almost 18 months, alone, utterly isolated, just a teeny mistake away from imminent death, and his mood never changes. It's amazing. It's baffling. I know astronauts are extraordinarily stalwart people, but still. Come on. Some vulnerability would have been interesting and realistic; maybe a breakdown or two would have been a nice touch. The sarcastic, gallows humor is great but its irksome after a while, especially when it never varies and downshifts into 12-year-old-boy territory. I kept hearing a laugh track playing in the background as I read. Why does Watney, a super trained mechanical engineer and botanist, need to be a cutesy standup comedian all the time in his logs and communiques? And I guess I just really wanted the storyline to go into darker places. Sigh. Make us pay emotionally as readers, Weir! * SPOILER AHEAD: Watney, the rescue mission—it all works out perfectly in the end and everyone lives happily ever after. Everyone. No one dies. Kind of ridiculous, even as I was pumping my fists in triumph at the end. *<br/><br/>But for all the thin air in this book, The Martian is still a thrilling story. I had fun. It gave me a new appreciation for NASA and our space program, and the people and all the moving parts that go into getting human beings closer to the cosmos.<br/><br/>Just don't forget the duct tape and bring good music.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R5B4E862ZJAH3?ASIN=1491590173	Crusoe on Mars, highly technical	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This is an exciting book with an old premise: an astronaut is stranded, in this case on Mars. He's wounded, his teammates have left him for dead, and his chances are slim to none. But Mark Watney, a wise-cracking botanist, refuses to give up. He's endlessly inventive and every step of the way he describes, in excruciating detail, how he gets food, water, air, power...you name it, he describes it. I had to take off one star because of this, although I think that science geeks might enjoy it thoroughly. As for me, I found myself skimming on most pages and for the first time in my life I thought it would have been great to see a condensed version of the story.<br/><br/>Eventually, the world finds out he's not dead and things get lively. Can Mark be rescued? What politics are involved? What science is necessary? What about the cost? Watney's situation becomes the ultimate reality show and the whole world is watching. There is a reasonable amount of humor for such a grim situation and the suspense ratchets up as the food, water and air supply dwindle. You'll never regard potatoes the same way again.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, none of the characters develop in any meaningful way, there is insufficient back story for our hero, and no depth to any of his psychology. What they're like the first time you see them is what they're like at the end of the book, which is why I removed another star.<br/><br/>I felt the book was somewhat realistic, but I don't have enough background in the subject to know what information, if any, was tweaked to enhance the story. It was a great story, but I wish I didn't have to skim so much technical stuff, which was really rather dry for me. I recommend this book to anyone interested in space travel who doesn't mind some profanity and irreverent humor. It is tailor-made to become a movie and without the constant details will undoubtedly be a smash success.</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2DJOLGSKS9700?ASIN=1491590173	It's a Journal Not A Novel	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">While there's no disputing the level of detail and ingenuity the author and lead character provide in this book I was really disappointed in the end result.<br/><br/>The book takes us through what could be a guide to Mars Survivability. Mark Watney’s MacGyver-like ingenuity is interesting for a few pages but its “Log Entry” format and mind numbing level of deal makes you wonder “Who Cares?” Do we really need a step-by-step description of how to create water from hydrazine?<br/><br/>The level of detail would be more palatable if the characters had some depth. The folks presented in the book are singularly one-dimensional and we’ve met them all before.<br/><br/>Finally, after enduring all of Watney’s Trials and Tribulations we arrive at a climax that’s anything but.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is a book only an engineer could love and if you’re going to call it a novel at least make it …entertaining, with characters that have some depth beyond the NASA stereotypes that have long become cliché.<br/><br/>I DO think ‘The Martian’ would make a great movie script. One of the few new ‘novels’ that would benefit from a Hollywood “Treatment”</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1TEZPECZN9CDT?ASIN=1491590173	great premise but writing was below average	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">The concept and story are amazing but the writing and dialogue aren't believable or good. Other reviews highlight the profanity and it is over the top. So is the ""dorky"" behavior. I wish the author had spent more time considering the psychology of the Martian rather than make 3rd grade jokes. All in all, I was glad I read the book but won't be recommending it to others.</span>"

3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1352KDC933KCZ?ASIN=1491590173	Cancel the Rescue Mission. The Astronaut Has No Pulse.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Have you ever wanted Apollo 13 and Castaway to be combined and then turned into a novel?<br/><br/>No? What do you mean no?<br/><br/>Mr. Weir manages to create a protagonist with a truly amazing will to live. Although ostensibly, very little to live for.<br/><br/>Left behind on Mars, there are no lovers, friends, family, or meaningful work awaiting Mark Watney on Earth that he hungers to return to. If there is, he doesn't mention it. There is no animosity born toward the crew that thought he was dead and left him behind. No.<br/><br/>There is just an unyielding desire to stay alive and a preternatural sense of good humor about his really f’ed up situation.<br/><br/>The majority of the book presents itself in an epistolary format, and from the beginning we are bombarded with what is essentially a laundry list of technical challenges to be overcome and the arithmetic related to working out those challenges. A brilliant engineer, Watney can apparently fix nearly any problem that comes his way. Of course, he didn't think of laying out rocks to spell SOS on the martian surface, but hey, who’s keeping score?<br/><br/>The answer was me. I’m keeping score.<br/><br/>NASA, that ever resourceful government agency, takes no photography of the “Hab” he is located at until two months after the incident that left him stranded. I find this difficult to believe. An incident occurred and they don’t take a photograph for two months? Even if they were trying to avoid bad PR from photographing a dead astronaut, this makes little sense. Their satellites probably would have picked up something unintentionally from regular surveillance by that point. And the guy’s dead. If his body’s there, the public will see it eventually.<br/><br/>The remainder of the characters also seem to be no nonsense engineers with little on their mind except their jobs. Can I get one warm blooded character, please?<br/><br/>I have to hand it to Weir, the pacing is good. The voice is unique. He lacks pretension. But none of this can make up for the fact that it’s hard to care about what’s going on. Why should I care about this protagonist? He seems to have no inner life. There is no emotional core in his character. It’s just a guy who wants to survive, and that isn't enough.</span>"
2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1UJJPLGNS71G3?ASIN=1491590173	No character development, poorly written dialogue, and just gets boring and predictable the longer you read it	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">[INCLUDES SPOILERS]<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever written an Amazon review in my life, but after finishing this book I feel like I have to take out my frustrations somewhere.<br/><br/>At the beginning it was very enjoyable, and I really wanted to keep enjoying it. I thought Watney's sense of humor was refreshing and I actually found myself laughing out loud more than once.<br/><br/>But as time went on, it was just more of the same over and over and over and over again. Somewhat predictable technical problem, pause, dry explanation of how he fixes it. Rinse, repeat. As many others have pointed out, there was zero character development. Watney's attitude and writing style seemed to be the same on day 1 as on day 450, after over a year of being almost completely isolated. We learn nothing about him as a person, or about anyone else for that matter. All the characters seemed very 1 dimensional.<br/><br/>The scientific solutions to his problems were interesting at first, but grew tiring later on as it just seemed like more of the same. I found my eyes glazing over and skimming parts, and I'm someone who really enjoys the science part of science fiction.<br/><br/>As I got further along in the book I realized I could hardly distinguish between the other characters. My first reaction was to go back and try to figure out who was who in the fictional version of NASA, but then I realized it didn't matter. Anyone could've been saying any of the lines. The easiest way to tell the characters apart was to look at the amount of needless profanity they used (and I mean truly needless -- I'm happy to have swearing where it makes sense and have no moral objection or anything).<br/><br/>Another reviewer pointed out that it sounded like Watney's journal entries were written by a teenager on reddit, and I think that's absolutely spot on. A couple of lines that really stuck out to me were when he jokingly referred to a probe as ""gay"" or towards the end of the book, as he's making the modifications to the ARES-4 MAV, he writes: ""The lunatics at NASA have me doing all kinds of rape to the MAV."" Seriously? Rape?<br/><br/>I stopped enjoying this book somewhere around a third of the way through, but I kept reading because I was invested and wanted to know what happened. If you find yourself at that point, do yourself a favor and just stop--it's not worth going on. It just gets worse and there's nothing satisfying about getting to the end.</span>"
2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3LFP6X5RJSBMD?ASIN=1491590173	Completely Underwhelmed	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">If you are interested in Sci-Fi that reads like it was written by a teenage boy, this is the book for you. The writing is so pedestrian  and the author feels the need to explain every little thing (example: ""CO2 is carbon dioxide"") that I couldn't get through the whole book. This is an author that thinks his audience isn't as smart as he is and, to give Weir credit, I feel pretty dumb for having spent my money on his book.</span>"
2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3GP2TN21X00WW?ASIN=1491590173	Great details but thin on character	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Highly readable as a sort of extended McGyver episode.  While I found the characterization of this book weak and the narrator at times annoying, I still found it compulsively readable as a detailed ""What if"" scenario.  It takes being stranded seriously, and applies the science of the situation rigorously.  And science is really what makes this book stand out.  It can make you love science again, for at its most basic it is applied ingenuity, and this book is full of that.  The main character here really isn't Mark Whatney, stranded astronaut.  The main character is science.<br/><br/>I would give the book a much higher rating if it weren't for the first person Mark Whatney sections, where I think the writer's inexperience shows.  The tone of voice there as narrated by Whatney seem much more filled with the writer's enthusiasm for his ideas than the astronaut's.  I just never bought the astronaut's tone of voice, which remained unchanging throughout his long ordeal.  I actually think the whole book would have been stronger in third person voice, because I often found myself wondering why Whatney would be writing in this way.<br/><br/>However, I gladly overlooked all that in order to experience a relatively realistic space scenario, that replaces standard action movie clichés with the rigorous safety protocols a trained engineer would use in such a situation.  As a licensed scuba diver and the son of a pilot, the constant safety steps really rang true to me.<br/><br/>And if you've got a kid anywhere near you at all interested in science, please do give them a copy of this book (but be warned -- the book does contain swearing).</span>"
2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R29I9CW9W3ULWO?ASIN=1491590173	Nice ideas, poor handling and storytelling.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">5 for plot, 0.25 for writing style. Over the top expositional writing (have he really wrote a hard sf book assuming that the reader can't multiply single digit numbers or doesn't know that a solar battery needs well...light? Really?), weakest character development I've read in a long time, completely unrealistic handling of the main character's emotions. Due to all above, the book is dull and really boring at times. There's just no drama. We all know that our cosmic hero will just handle everything no matter how hard would that be with a stoic approach throwing jokes around. Boring....</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R386TWOK4K1Q80?ASIN=1491590173	Sophomoric humor	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">The concept is interesting, but the writer is kind of sophomoric in his comedy, it was distracting to me throughout the book.</span>"
2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RNRW211DIICM3?ASIN=1491590173	Very entertaining reading!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I throughly enjoyed The Martian by Andy Weir.  I was really drawn into the book through its ability to make me feel and understand Mark Watney's experience while giving me just the right dose of science to teach me something but not make it a technical read.  This book is not for young readers as it has some situationally appropriate language that some parents may not approve of.  If they are a mature reader it should be fine.</span>"
2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2OTSPK6I2QRYS?ASIN=1491590173	A page-turning realistic depiction of survival on Mars	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">It has been a long time since I read a hard science fiction story that was a page-turner. I had a few very late nights of reading as I just did not want to put the book down, and there were no really dead spots that made for a natural go-to-bed location.<br/><br/>Weir does a great job of inserting real science into this novel. If you've ever read about Robert Zubrin's ""Mars Direct"" plan for how to go about getting exploration missions to the red planet, it appears that this was used extensively for the core technologies in the book.<br/><br/>The stranded astronaut, a botanist and mechanic, figures out some quite ingenious inventions to survive. It was much more interesting than the old movie ""Robin Crusoe on Mars"" (which I really liked!) and without any aliens or annoying monkeys.<br/><br/>There also were tremendously funny lines throughout the novel, and I found myself laughing out loud at many points.<br/><br/>Others have mentioned that there was too much profanity, but that didn't bother me at all. Who doesn't curse when something goes horribly wrong? It didn't diminish my enjoyment of the novel, but if you are very sensitive to this, be warned. The expletives are mild and standard, but they are sprinkled liberally in the text at some points.<br/><br/>I am definitely trying an new novel Weir comes out with in the future.</span>"
4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R32NCRD66BTLVF?ASIN=1491590173	Science, maybe. Fiction? BAD, BAD, BAD.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I just couldn't finish this without skipping huge portions of it. There's no depth here; it would be interesting to a survivalist who might end up on Mars some day, but I wish the character had some depth. Any depth. At first, I thought it was natural that the main character's log of his experiences focused on the technology, with 1/100th relating to the entertainment left behind by other astronauts. But I found out that this is his ENTIRE log. Nothing about missing people from home. No introspection. Just, ""I did this. Then I did this. Then I did this. And then I did this."" Over and over again. I was so relieved when it got to a section about NASA people on earth trying to figure out what's happening, but there the dialogue is so unreal and, again, there's no depth, that even that bored me very quickly.<br/><br/>I agree with other reviewers that the reviews here MUST be friends of Andy Weir's or the publisher or something. There is no way that thousands of people would give this book such a high rating. As science, maybe it's OK. As fiction, it's terrible. As science fiction it's just terrible.<br/><br/>I also agree with other reviewers that if this is made into a movie, the movie will undoubtedly be ten times better than the book. Somebody will get ahold of this and make the characters real and interesting.</span>"
4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RJ8GSP5OTUFUO?ASIN=1491590173	WOW! - A great read!  Well researched, well structured! WOW!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I purchased this book based on the reviews.  I am a streaky reader.  I'll read a bunch of Sci-Fi and then move to historical drama and then to Biographies and then to baseball.  I've read and loved all of the Wool series and am eagerly awaiting Third Shift.  This book jumped out at me and I bought it figuring it would be a nice little read until something jumped out at me.  I had just finished Pillars of the Earth and needed a break so I jumped into my Sci-Fi mode.  This book was not a nice little break, it was a tremendous read and now I've added Mr. Weir to my must read list.<br/><br/>I was believing that the author must have been an astronaut prior to becoming an author with the detail he put behind the technology and strategies of a Mars landing, life on Mars, the return trip and all of the trials and tribulations that the main character faces in his time alone on Mars.  This may scare some people away, but don't the detail is what is needed.  He vividly describes the problem, why it happened and then steers the character through a very viable and believable solution.  An average author could not have pulled this book off to the degree that Mr. Weir did.<br/><br/>The bouncing around between the daily (SOL) log book and the characters on Earth who are working out solutions to help bring the main character back home are done very smoothly.  The prospect of reading a log book gave me reservation.  The entries in the log book were thorough, filled with sarcasm, humor and spirit.  It would exactly be how I would have approached entries in my log book had I been stranded on Mars.  With no one to talk with, the absurdity of my situation and in the remote hopes that someone would actually read this log book someday, you wouldn't pull any punches.<br/><br/>A strong 5 star rating for this book.  For those of you who complain about grammar, spelling or punctuation errors in an e-book, get over it.  Look past these issues and appreciate the genius of this writer and be thankful that at $0.99, you can read high quality material such as, ""The Martian""<br/><br/>I'll be reading more Mr. Weir.  Keep up the great work!</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2TX54YKNMYKER?ASIN=1491590173	Good for a read but not great literature.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">What's impressive is Weirs knowledge of his subject yet I wish he had the same capacity with writing.  Riveting at times and cheesy at others, I found myself distracted by very flat characters and a flat telling of the story.  The novel should of been entirely told by Watney's logs.  I didn't really care towards the end what would happen. Unique premise bogged down in trite mainstream gimmicky.  The soul was Lost in the stars.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3OP6G3Q26NHIA?ASIN=1491590173	Liked it...but didn't love it	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This is another one of those books that are really kind of hard for me to review. I expected to be blown away by this book. Everything about this book sounded absolutely perfect. A man stranded on Mars....it just doesn't get more exciting than that. I wasn't blown away. I liked the story well enough but I have to admit that sometimes the science got a little too much for me. I ended up enjoyed some parts of the book much more than others but I do think that this book will be a great framework for a very good movie.<br/><br/>Basically, anyone who has seen a movie preview or read the synopsis for this book has a basic understanding of the story line. Mark Watney is part of a group of astronauts doing some work on Mars. When things go horribly wrong, Mark is left alone on the planet and must figure out how to survive long enough to possibly be rescued.<br/><br/>I liked a lot of the book quite a bit. Some things just became a bit much for me. I loved Mark's sense of humor....to a point. At times, it was just a bit much. I appreciate being able to laugh during times of adversity but I don't think that anyone could have remained in such good spirits being isolated and alone as Mark was during most of the book. I didn't dislike Mark but I didn't fall in love with him either. I am thinking that movie Mark will be a little harder to resist because.....well, Matt Damon.<br/><br/>I found the science in the story to be very interesting....until it wasn't anymore. Enough is enough and there were times in the story that it was just too much. I like science. I felt like the science took over the plot of the book at times. If Mark had someone to discuss the science with it probably would have fit into the plot better possibly as conversation. Some of the science in the book really felt like information dumping to me and I found myself setting the book aside to do other things.<br/><br/>I liked most of the scenes that took place on Earth and on the spacecraft. I really thought that the parts of the book where characters were able to interact with each other worked well. I actually liked the parts that Mark was able to communicate. A story of one man's thoughts about science on Mars can get a bit dull. I also think that there were a lot of very exciting sections in the book that really kept me glued to the book. The parts that I liked....I really liked.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to others. I think most readers will really enjoy this story and I know that a lot of people are looking forward to the movie. I still can't believe that I jumped on the bandwagon with the timing of reading this book. I must admit that I can't wait to see the movie with my husband. This is the first book by Andy Weir that I have read and I look forward to other works by this author.</span>"
2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1HL51XW3B0NXL?ASIN=1491590173	Great audiobook!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Well you can read the synopsis from the other 9,000 reviewers so I'll bypass that here.<br/><br/>WARNING: For those that care.  .from the opening line and throughout there is heavy adult language. Not necessarily crass or sexual in nature, but a lot of F-bombs and other language. Thus if you are sensitive to this type of writing or want to keep your kids away from it, know that it's here.<br/><br/>This was an genius story.<br/>Everything felt authentic and rooted in great, in-depth research. The breadth of issues that happen and how ingenuity and science win out was an amazing feat that paid off.<br/><br/>Good humor scattered throughout.<br/><br/>Likable main character. This is a must for me and I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>I didn't feel any parts lagged, not even the middle.<br/><br/>The ending was worth it.<br/><br/>You know that there is basically one character so by the nature of the story he is not going to die in the Act I. But even with this, the suspense was good because he may not die since we still have a couple of hundred pages to go, but you as the reader are wondering how bad will it be for him after this.<br/><br/>The story is well paced and logical, with no acts of god to come to the rescue.<br/><br/>OVERALL: The actor did a great audio reading job, which only enhanced the drama of the story and made it one of 2015's best reads so far.</span>"

It is like an old movie serial where each week the hero has to extricate himself from some impossible situation.

4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZDJEUI3DFV9L?ASIN=1491590173	Interesting Concept, but not what I expected	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">The first pages of the book are the best part. Marooned on Mars, millions of miles from the next living person, with no method of communication or escape, and everyone thinks he's dead. From the concept, I expected a lonely descent into the inner workings of the narrator's mind: lost loves, memories from long ago, deep regrets, soliloquies of an easy suicide versus the primal instinct of living. All these thoughts set against the harsh, cold, desolate, blood red Martian desert.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that book I'll have to wait to read. This book is very different. Mark, our protagonist, is a lively humorous fellow, who is always quick with a joke. Even after he's abandoned on Mars, he only laments the lack of quality music to listen to. While his attempts to survive and communicate with Earth with MacGyvered tools are interesting, unfortunately after the first few times, it becomes quite boring and predictable. Mark's dry, sarcastic wit only serves to annoy us. A typical joke would go something like this ""Harvested 5 pounds of space potatoes today. Woo! Botany major FTW!"" So, yea, not so funny. Theres also a dearth of character development. We never get to know Mark. Who does he think about when he sleeps? What does he think about mortality now that his life is in jeopardy? We'll never know.<br/><br/>All in all, a cool concept, some interesting macgyvering, but ruined by not taking itself seriously.</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RSTG1MAXO7FFL?ASIN=1491590173	Warning: There are no martians in this book	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Lets get that out of the way first. There are no Martians in this book.<br/>What it is, is a hypothetical manual on what could go wrong and how to survive when it does, on Mars, if you ever happen to be stranded there.<br/><br/>Mark is a likeable character, self motivated, inventive and courageous, however he could as well be a paper cut out.<br/><br/>For a guy stranded on uninhabitable planet, with little chance of survival, and plenty that could go wrong, his undying self motivation is one ... of a robot.<br/>What exactly keeps him motivated to live, I don't know. Because you see, Mark has no real ties to earth. There is no wife/girlfriend, children, not even a close friend of real family ties that would be the reason for him to get up every day and face incredible dangers and fuel his MacGiver like inventiveness.<br/><br/>The writers attempt to pre empty this question, with a few sentences of Mark's psychological pro filing as an optimist and a joker, hardly cuts it.<br/><br/>Some mention this is a book is for geeks and engineers, but I don't know about that. I am married to an engineer and have a super geek for a brother and I can tell you, when they talk, they don't sound like juveniles pretending to be super intelligent adults working for NASA.<br/>That in my opinion was on of the weaker points of this book. The diagoues seriously lacked wit and were more like the pre programmed conversation you hear in a Si-fi computer game in a 13year old's bedroom.<br/><br/>Good effort for a self published author, but  I would have liked this story to be little bit more about Marks personal journey: loneliness, despair, self reflection, maybe spiritual or religious reflections in face of imminent danger?<br/>I would like Mark to have a bit of personality and depth, to keep the story more emotional and engaging.</span>"
2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3IP9KBVTOX22R?ASIN=1491590173	Could not put it down. ...	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I am firmly in the camp of those reviewers who've said ""This is the best hard sci-fi I've read in a looong while"". Got it as a bedtime read - finally had to surrender to sleep at something after 2am. And was right back on it first thing the next morning (thank goodness for the holidays).<br/><br/>Mixes the best of the HW Bush era SEI program with Zubrin's Mars Direct. Takes the dry details &amp; brings them pulse-poundingly(is that a word? even hyphenated?) to life.<br/><br/>One of the best 99 cent books out there. I'll definitely be looking for more from Andy Weir!</span>"
2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2AQMVN3NWKIRN?ASIN=1491590173	Fun read made heavy by technical details	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I had no idea there were so many astro physicists making reviews on Amazon - who else would give this book 5 stars?<br/><br/>The ""stranded on Mars"" premise is fascinating and is what made me buy this book. How the heck will he get out of this jam, i wondered. I also secretly hoped there would be aliens (there were none). Instead we get to learn in long tedious detail - and i mean DETAIL - how the Martian manages to improvise himself out of every dangerous situation using mathematics, chemistry and physics. Doesn't matter if its a sand storm, lack of food or whatever - he will put some stuff together like a space McGyver and make everything ok again while cheerfully joking about it in his space log.<br/><br/>Now, if you are indeed an astronaut or space engineer reading this book, i would assume you would nod your head, rub your beard and think ""yeah, thats pretty much how it would be done"" but for the rest of us, its just a bunch of technical stuff we cant relate to. How much is even real tech or made up future tech? If most of it is made up future tech - the entire book becomes irrelevant. There are MUCH better sci-fi reads out there if youre looking for cool fantasy technology.<br/><br/>The only thing that grabbed me was him beeing alone at Mars and Nasa finding out he was there alive. The rest just becomes a long winded problem solving tech porn drama with predictable events and even anti-climaxes.<br/><br/>Over-rated, but for a geek like me it was still a nice read but no more than 3 stars = ""good"", not great and certainly not ""epic"".</span>"

Aptly titled 'The Martian' because none of the characters act like they're from Earth. It's kind of fun, but reads like the solution to the world's longest maths problem. No, wait! It actually reads like a 350-page version of the spiel from the old Chinese man in the House of Evil in Treehouse of Horror III ""The Frogurt is also cursed..."". A lot of potential, and I hope the Ridley Scott movie coming out later this year proves to be good, but it's essentially this year's Da Vinci Code.</span>"

He begins a journal of his survival efforts, punctuating the details of chemistry and makeshift botany with ""Yay!"" and ""Boo!"" and ""LOL!!!!"" to liven things up. Things go pear-shaped, Mark figures out a work around, and repeat. The level of tension and introspection (not to mention the vocabulary) is a lot like one of those you-tube video game walk throughs.<br/><br/>I much preferred the chapters back on Earth, about the politics of announcing that a man had been left behind, and the plans to recover him. Not a lot of depth here, either. It's not so much a novel as an extended movie pitch - and I hear it worked, so bravo for Mr. Weir.</span>"

2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R470U1LP2B1LF?ASIN=1491590173	A Science Adventure Story, or How To Survive Without Google	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This book is to basic science what Asimov's ""I, Robot"" is to basic logic and Gaarder's ""Sophie's World"" is to basic philosophy: You'll get some fun lessons in basic physics, chemistry, biology, math and technology.<br/><br/>Don't let the small percentage of critics scare you away from this book, telling you it's ""hard sci-fi"" more suitable for engineers, techies and nerds. All of the science is at a basic level and it's nicely embedded within the adventure/survival narrative. That said, there IS a lot of basic science, so if you are completely bored with science, then and only then I might suggest that this story would bore you.<br/><br/>I recommend this book for middle school and high school kids - for some kids it might even inspire an interest in science they didn't have before. (I have a niece who got interested in science from watching ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation."") However, I will warn parents that this book does contain a few f-bombs. Astronauts can say the darndest things when faced with life-and-death scenarios. Thankfully the profanity is few and far between and there's no sex to speak of. Kids reading this book might even get some ideas for school science projects.<br/><br/>Likewise, don't let critics scare you away with talk of poor character development and clunky dialogue. It's all nonsense. For a science/adventure/survival story, the character development and dialogue are appropriate and natural. Some folks seem to expect ""Middlemarch."" Others grouse that this is MacGyver on Mars, with one problem-solving episode after another. I won't deny that problems are solved, but there's a difference: MacGyver's solutions are largely gimmicky, where he created complex Rube Goldberg devices in a few short minutes, while our hero on Mars, Watney, works with more realistic materials in more realistic timeframes. And unlike MacGyver, the only bad guy Watney has to fight is Mars.<br/><br/>""The Martian"" is basic science wrapped up in an adventure story. Just like Asimov made logic fun and Gaarder made philosophy fun, Weir has made science fun. The people who don't like this book don't like science, but they don't want to admit that. Don't let them talk you out of giving this book a chance. There's nothing wrong with not liking science, but give it a chance. And don't expect ""Middlemarch.""</span>"
2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2RXDYCCTBWEJH?ASIN=1491590173	Five Big Stars: An outstanding, edge of your seat listen that brings duct tape and ingenuity to Mars.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Astronaut Mark Watney wakes up and finds himself injured and alone on Mars. His crew mates believed him dead, so they were forced to leave him behind. Faced with impossible circumstances and utterly alone, Mark Watney refuses to give up. His quick thinking and smarts help him to devise a plan to try and get rescued. Unfortunately, the odds are insurmountable. Watney faces starvation, a hostile environment, and he has no way to contact NASA. Can some duct tape and ingenuity help him find a way home?<br/><br/>What I Liked:<br/>*I am an eclectic reader, but I can honestly say, I wouldn't likely have picked up The Martian on my own, and I would have totally missed out. This is a sci-fi book packed full of math and science and danger, and I absolutely loved it. This book was so fun to listen to. I was rooting for the hapless Mark Watney, and I completely fell in love with his never say die attitude and his unwavering sense of humor. Think of this book as MacGyver stranded on Mars. Yes, even on Mars, duct tape is miraculous. Trust me, even if sci-fi is outside your normal reading zone, you should read this. It is so good that a movie is in the works starring Matt Damon!<br/>*Mark Watney is the star of the show. You would think reading an entire book surrounding one guy stranded alone on Mars would be boring, but nope, it's not. What makes this book shine is Watney's humor. He is always cracking jokes and making sarcastic remarks that help liven up some of the more dry science passages(ninja pirates). I absolutely adored is comedic remarks, his commentary on seventies tv and music was hilarious. Most of the book is told via Watney's blog entries where he relates his Martian antics and failures via a computer journal in hopes that someone someday will be able to retrieve it because he realizes his situation is rather dire. Yet he refuses to give up. Talk about resourceful. Time and time again, he manages to figure out a solution using math and his smarts. Watney actually proves how valuable those algebra story problems can be. Loved, loved, loved, Mark Watney. Geeky botanist or not, he is totally hot.<br/>*After a certain point, the book switches view points and you start getting voices from people down on Earth who are desperate to find a way to save Watney. I enjoyed getting inside the heads of the powers that be at NASA and learning about all the obstacles and red tape that had to be dealt with in order to try and save Watney. Eventually, you even get the view points of his former crew mates. I thought the way this story was executed was brilliant, and I thoroughly enjoyed all the view points.<br/>*Let's talk about the science parts. This is an incredibly realistic and obviously well researched book. The author takes us through all the science in what is necessary to survive on Mars. You learn about all kinds of fascinating stuff. There are lots of passages where Watney explains the science behind whatever he is doing, whether it be trying to make water or rocket fuel, or even growing potatoes. I know some of you are worried that reading all the scientific details would get a bit dry, but for the most part, it was awesome, thanks to Watney's fun narratives. Watney spices it up, and makes you laugh as he explains things. So even if you don't like sci-fi books with lots of science, you will enjoy this one thanks to the humor.<br/>*I kid you not, this is truly an edge of your seat thriller. Watney's life is constantly on the line as he tries to survive one harrowing experience after another. He faces insurmountable odds as he battles starvation, shelter issues, a long arduous journey across Mars to hopefully be rescued, dust storms, explosions, etc. It is literally one mishap after another, and the reader quickly learns early on if it can go wrong, it more than likely will. This is an addictive read/listen that you won't be able to put down as you just have to know if he will survive from one predicament to the next, and most of all, if he will actually get off Mars, because trust me when I tell you, the odds are stacked against him like you wouldn't believe.<br/>*This is a book where I absolutely can't recommend the audiobook enough. R. C. Bray brilliantly narrates this one, and he brings Mark Watney to life. He is outstanding. This is the first time I have listened to this narrator and it won't be my last. He vaults his way up there next to Will Patton and Luke Daniels on my favorite male narrator list. I think this one is better to listen to vs. reading, as Bray manages to make all those scientific passages funny. I don't think I would have been as engaged if I had read it vs. listening. If you can, get your hands on the audio.<br/>And The Not So Much:<br/>*Without giving away too much, I was left at the end wanting more. I would have loved to see it extend just a little bit.<br/>*For the most part, I enjoyed all the scientific jargon and the explanations. Weir manages to deliver it in a way where it is relatively easy to understand, but I do admit, there were a few times, especially toward the end when I was overly anxious, that some of it went a bit over my head and I had to listen again. Still I loved all the detail, the science and the explanations. If you are a detail reader and you love science, you cannot miss this one.<br/><br/>The Martian is without a doubt going to end up on my best of 2015 list. This is a book I would likely not have picked up on my own, but thanks to all the stellar reviews, I grabbed it, and I am certainly glad I did. This was a fabulous listen, and I cannot recommend the audiobook enough. This is a brilliant book full of science, danger, life and death situations and,believe it or not, humor. Do yourself a favor and get a copy of this before the movie comes out. You do not want to miss this book! Outstanding!<br/><br/>I borrowed a copy of this book from the library. All opinions are my own, and I was not compensated for this review.<br/>Posted@Rainy Day Ramblings.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1KYGH7QJ7NCCM?ASIN=1491590173	My mission to Mars was a gratifying and pleasant adventure; I liked this book and I heartily recommend it!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">// If anything, The Martian made me feel quite unaccomplished, because it’s an “intelligent” read, but I will say this: I feel confident and almost certain that my IQ went up just a tad bit after reading this narrative ;)<br/><br/>// I’m not too keen with Andy Weir’s writing style, but his conceptual leap molds the overall premise of this narrative brilliantly!<br/><br/>// A survival fiction stationed on Mars!? Yes, please! The suspense and uncertainties surrounding Mark Watney will haunt you long after you’ve put down the book; that’s for sure!<br/><br/>// The Martian is a relatively fast paced hardcore sci-fi novel based on scientific reality, not fantasy by any means<br/><br/>// Because The Martian is an “intelligent” book, it is riddled with technical and scientific details that mentally challenge you to think about what is taking place, what might possibly happen, and what the consequences of said possibilities may result in; it’s all so strangely addicting too<br/><br/>// More than anything, The Martian made me want to start wearing glasses and hang out with intelligent cultured people; what is that about?<br/><br/>// Mark Watney’s character is really what made this novel a compelling and interesting read for me; he’s like a modified version of Sherlock Holmes but under a scientific umbrella if that makes any sense :?<br/><br/>// My mission to Mars was a gratifying and pleasant adventure; I liked this book and I heartily recommend it to fans who are up for a more challenging read. It’s a total nerd book to say the least!<br/><br/>3 THINGS I LIKED:<br/>{+} Mark Watney’s witty voice, sarcastic humor and cynical remarks kept me riveted and literally, laughing out loud. That’s not all there is to this biting and caustic character, Mark Watney is strikingly intelligent too! He takes known facts and reaches conclusions at an incredibly rapid measure, he creates new scientific theories and modifies space technology and objects in moments where it would take a normal scientist weeks or years! He even goes as far as to crunch down difficult math equations without pen or paper! And you unknowingly become mesmerized with it all; his natural ability to process information, solve equations and overcome unfathomable obstacles. With these themes in mind, coupled with the most hilarious one-liners ever, you’ve got yourself one of the best sarcastic protagonists of all time; what a riot it all was!<br/><br/>You don’t tire of Watney’s snarky approach either, because his obnoxious behavior is the only thing preventing him from losing his mind, and you can’t help but to root for the guy; oh man, I so enjoyed this more than I should have. There are, in all seriousness, a plethora of priceless hilarious one-liners in this narrative, that to list them would mean, I would have to share at least half of the book, but in order to avoid any sort of lawsuit, here are a few of my favorite:<br/><br/>- ""This is my food supply. All natural, organic, Martian-grown potatoes. Don’t hear that every day, do you?<br/><br/>- ""There’s no backup, and they think I’ll die instantly without it. To them, equipment failure is terrifying. To me, it’s “Tuesday.”<br/><br/>- ""Firstly, hydrazine is some serious death. If I make any mistakes, there’ll be nothing left but the “Mark Watney Memorial Crater” where the Hab once stood<br/><br/>- ""The planet’s famous red color is from oxide coating everything. So it’s not just a desert. It’s a desert so old it’s literally rusting.<br/><br/>- ""I don’t want to come off as arrogant here, but I’m the best botanist on the planet.<br/><br/>- ""They say once you grow crops somewhere, you have officially “colonized” it. So technically, I colonized Mars. In your face, Neil Armstrong!<br/><br/>- ""Hey, don’t get me wrong, I’m not a mama’s boy or anything. I’m a full-grown man who only occasionally wears diapers (you have to in an EVA suit).<br/><br/>{+} The hidden jewel for me was in the unpredictability of a survival prose on Mars! You are immediately plopped right into the middle of Mars, and then the real mission begins as you struggle to survive in a primitive way. . .wait, am I talking about me or Mark Watney? Well, in a sense it felt like my mission too, because as a matter of fact, I was left breathless and wide-eyed throughout the entire story as Watney took me along on his wild escapades throughout Mars on a rover no less; as well as the hazardous experiments that had me at the edge of my seat! It was all so thrilling!<br/><br/>{+} It’s a book turned movie! The cast looks promising, but considering Mark Watney’s charming arrogance, I couldn’t help but to think that Robert Downy Jr., or perhaps George Clooney (in light of his recent role inGravity) would have played a better Mark Watney role. BUT, since we have yet to see the film, I will leave my thoughts here, and hope that Matt Damon will live up to this fantastic character arc. It’s going to be fascinating to see the real life-threatening moments come to life on film too; I seriously cannot wait!<br/><br/>3 THINGS I DID NOT LIKE:<br/>{-} At some point in a novel, authors are inclined to have to provide chunks of information in order to get the setting, mood, point across to the reader, I understand this, however with The Martian, the expository of information dumping is exceedingly overwhelming. But it’s a novel situated on Mars Claudia! Yeeeaaaaah, but no, it’s a completely different level of sci-fi friends. The way in which Mark Watney explains his arguments, observations and theories referencing numerous elements from the periodic table (which by the way I vaguely remember) within the narrative, seriously feels as though you are sitting in an astronomy science class at a university. Here allow me to give you some perspective:<br/><br/>- “My best bet for making calories is potatoes. They grow prolifically and have a reasonable caloric content (770 calories per kilogram). I’m pretty sure the ones I have will germinate. Problem is I can’t grow enough of them. In 62 square meters, I could grow maybe 150 kilograms of potatoes in 400 days (the time I have before running out of food). That’s a grand total of 115,500 calories a sustainable average of 288 calories per day. With my height and weight, if I’m willing to starve a little, I need 1500 calories per day.""<br/><br/>- “The oxygenator will turn it into oxygen in its own time. Then, I’ll release hydrazine, very slowly, over the iridium catalyst, to turn it into N2 and H2. I’ll direct the hydrogen to a small area and burn it. As you can see, this plan provides many opportunities for me to die in a fiery explosion.""<br/><br/>- “The regulator uses freeze-separation to sort out the gases. When it decides there’s too much oxygen, it starts collecting air in a tank and cooling it to 90 kelvin. That makes the oxygen turn to liquid, but leaves the nitrogen (condensation point: 77K) still gaseous. Then it stores the O2.<br/><br/>But I can’t get it to do that for hydrogen, because hydrogen needs to be below 21K to turn to liquid, And the regulator just can’t get temperatures that low. Dead end.<br/><br/>Here’s the solution:<br/>Hydrogen is dangerous because it can blow up. But it can only blow up if there’s oxygen around. Hydrogen without oxygen is harmless. And the regulator is all about pulling oxygen out of the air.""<br/><br/>See what Andy Weir does here at the end? It’s like Science for Dummies! First, he demonstrates his extensive knowledge in mathematics and scientific notations, and then subtlety lays it down for readers like me! Yeah, this {points to head} doesn’t seem to function properly when it comes to science Mr. Weir, I need visuals, illustrations and models of the sort; especially with science and math. But man, you Sir have my respect! Still, I think a condensed version of information would have been more effective, aaand, I think I’ll stick to Dr. Walt Brown, he grabs my attention<br/><br/>{-} Foul language plays out best when it is used sparingly, or at least in moderation; for this reason, it behooves me to say, the profanity in this novel was a major turn off for me. Okay, humans get angry yes, and Mark Watney is stranded on Mars, thus I can see how he might possibly find it comforting and relieving to stress his frustrations using raw language, but what really threw me off was the way in which Andy Weir penned NASA. I am not kidding when I say this, every single bureaucrat conversed in such a rude, ignorant, socially unacceptable way that left me feeling no respect for them whatsoever. NASA was poorly delivered in terms of character. Is NASA that unsteady and ill-equipped to belittle someone, or some event, that they must resort to such tasteless abusive words? It just didn’t seem to fit their well-versed character; they’re incredibly literate professionals! So why must you drench me with so much swearing NASA!? Ugh! I was extremely agitated and utterly disturbed to say the least<br/><br/>{-} I don’t know about you, but when I think of Mars, I think of aliens {shrugs &amp; shakes head} no aliens here my friends; The Martian is actually Mark Watney! Clever huh? One more thing, owing to the fact that the narrative is an “information dumping book,” the world-setting and overall mood fell short for me. BUT, I still enjoyed the narrative and think it’s worth reading<br/><br/>Overall Rating:<br/>Storyline | 5/5<br/>Characters | 2/5<br/>World Setting | 3/5<br/>Moral Value | 1/5<br/>Cover Art | 3/5<br/>Overall | 3/5<br/><br/>Violence | Mild<br/>Profanity | Extreme<br/>Sexual Content | None<br/>Drugs &amp; Alcohol | None<br/><br/>Mature subjects/themes include, but are limited to: Suspense and non-stop peril, suicide, loss</span>"
4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1BG2Z9RIBC5AI?ASIN=1491590173	Funny, nerdy, space survival. Perfect for its target audience.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This book made me laugh out loud on page two. It’s my kind of book.<br/>I say this because it’s important to know up front that this book isn’t for everyone. “But… everyone loves to laugh,” you say.  Sure, but there are different kinds of humor, and the humor of this book is only going to appeal to certain types of readers. It’s gallows-nerd humor. If you don’t like sarcasm or are not at least in some small way nerdy, or nerd-leaning, there is a good chance you could hate this book. This book is about an astronaut stranded on Mars. Astronauts are a bunch of brilliant, problem-solving, planet-jumping bad@sses. But they’re still nerds. So yeah, plan for that going in. You will learn stuff in this book that you forgot as soon as the bell rang on your final sophomore chem class. Thankfully, Mark Watney—our hero—remembered his lessons. And he’s going to use them to MacGuyver his way across a planet that’s trying very hard to kill him. He will use his super nerd powers, and the most inspiring will to survive I have ever read in a character, to do stuff like turn water into rocket fuel. “You can’t turn water into rocket fuel,” you’re saying. Oh yes you can. Chemistry b*tches! Not only that, he’ll be the first Martian gardener. Botany b*tches! (Okay, I’m done with that now.)<br/><br/>Andy Weir has done an amazing job in writing this novel. You would swear he was an astronaut himself. Apparently he’s not, but I bet he knows some. I can totally picture him hanging out with astronaut buddies, playing foosball and saying things like, “After this game, you guys want another round? And by the way, how many amp-hours does a rover battery draw when you route it in series with a life support system and a water reclaimer? Buzz, you good on that whiskey sour? Lovell, how you doing on beer over there? Remind me to ask you about how to rewire a carbon dioxide filtration system, okay?”<br/><br/>Research out the ying yang, but you don’t have worry about this book lacking in tension. Weir ratchets up the danger level for our intrepid hero so often you hardly get a chance to breathe. Just as one terrible life-threatening disaster is averted, there are three more lurking on the horizon. Seriously, Tom Hanks had it easy on that island. Hell, he had it easy in that tiny space capsule, too. The Moon, psshhhh, that’s like a trip to the back yard…<br/><br/>This is a tale of survival. Which brings up another good point. If you are expecting a lot of dialogue in a story, don’t read this book about a castaway, then complain about having to read log entries. We can’t all have friendly-looking volleyballs to talk to. And let’s stop for a minute and appreciate the fact that if we were reading the story from the perspective of some omniscient narrator, or hero’s retelling, we would lose most of the tension. If you are reading journal entries, you don’t know if the person who wrote them is alive or not. He was after all on a planet with a 758% chance of killing him. It’s annoying to read one-star reviews from people who bailed twenty percent in and whined about the format. Have a little faith people. (It’s not all log entries. And YES there will be dialogue and omniscient narrators at some points.) Weir uses all the story telling tools at his disposal to get this tale across, and for me, it worked nicely.<br/><br/>This book is not for everyone. But if you like science and space and enjoy self-deprecating nerdy survival humor, and want to be inspired by what the human spirit can accomplish, this book nails it. It’s a fictional Apollo 13 for a new generation—that reads like real life. Also, the cover art was gorgeous, so kudos to the cover designer. I paid full retail for this in hardback even though I knew it had an eBook just because I love the way it’s going to look on my bookshelf.<br/><br/>Thank you, Andy Weir, for satisfying my lust for space exploration, and making me appreciate things like the atmosphere, and drinking water that hasn’t ever been urine. I’ve been to Mars now, and I’m happy to have made it back.</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R16MDGNVOJR0N0?ASIN=1491590173	Phenomenal	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">The Martian took me by surprise. If I am honest, I have yo say I was ready to give up on this book after 50 pages. It's not that I didn't find it interesting enough, or well written, or even scientifically accurate, because it really was all these things. I just found it hard to connect with the lead character.<br/><br/>  Mark Watney was not a character I immediately connected with. In fact, it took me long time to even get to the point when I would tolerate him, what with all his jokes and jackass behavior. I didn't understand how a person left to die alone on a different planet could be so lighthearted, cheerful and in the mood for random jokes. It wasn't until I finally realized, that, had he been any more serious or depressing, I would have hated his guts even more. Mark made the best out of the situation he found himself in, and I learned to appreciate his optimism and zest for life. His brave attitude was truly admirable. He was a clever problem-solver, and in situations where most of us would probably break down and cry, he looked for solutions and ways to troubleshoot. And his jokes and surprisingly positive attitude? Well, I realize now that without it, the whole novel would have been pointless, he might've as well just shoot himself in the head in the first chapter.<br/><br/>  By the end of the book, I was a huge fan of Mark Watney and his biting sense of humor. He is such a fantastic, complex, intelligent and sharp character, I actually miss his inappropriate remarks and nerdy observations. He grew on me, like no other character ever did, and I wish I knew someone like Watney in real life.<br/><br/>  The concept behind this novel is really rather simple, and really kind of brilliant in its simplicity. Can you even imagine how incredibly terrifying it would be to be left behind, all alone, on a planet thousands of miles away from home? Knowing that you don't have enough supplies to last anywhere long enough for the rescue mission to come and save you? Not even having any means of communicating to others that you're alive? Boy, I would probably give up and die on the spot the moment I'd realize the extent of just how screwed I was.<br/><br/>  The premise was blood chilling in both the concept and its execution. Mark is a fighter, but Mars itself is definitely a worthy opponent. Everything that can go wrong, does, and it's a never ending battle against time and Mars' deadly atmosphere. The sense of urgency and danger is omnipresent, almost palpable and claustrophobic, to the point that you're having trouble breathing yourself while reading about Mark running out of oxygen, or you suddenly feel the urge to stock up on food supplies, while reading about Mark's desperate attempts at growing potatoes on Mars (and really, just how cool is that?).<br/><br/>  I loved how scientifically accurate this book was. All the scientific detail made this story very believable, and therefore that much more terrifying. The many bits and pieces of information and data, endless calculations and predictions, detailed descriptions, etc.. It all made for an interesting read. And even though it was definitely a bit heavy on the scientific stuff, it was never boring or disconnected. Andy did a great job of balancing the intense plot line with the scientific information, creating a story that while mentally stimulating, complex and challenging, was also very entertaining and emotionally engaging. And Mark's awesomely bad-a** character played a vital role in making this a very accessible and enjoyable read.<br/><br/>  I would recommend this book to all science fiction fans, especially those who appreciate a great, thrilling story with a carefully fleshed out scientific background. You won't be disappointed.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R17DB45HNCNXM7?ASIN=1491590173	Fun book, incredible narration by R.C. Bray.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Fun book, incredible narration by R.C. Bray.<br/><br/>You could summarize the plot as Apollo 13 meets Robinson Crusoe, with a dash of Cast Away.<br/>You can see the official summaries, but I want to tell you about three things that made this fantastic for me.<br/>1. Overall plot - if you describe it to someone, it sounds as if it could have been written by Heinlein or one of the other greats.  It's a great engineering/adventure story.  There was a ton of ""hard SF"" detail (or probably more exactly ""S"" - I got a strong feeling that Weir did his homework on this) but the author works hard to avoid the classic ""As you know Bob, the oxygenator works through . . . "" and actually makes it central to the plot - making it much easier to follow for someone who has basic scientific knowledge, but is *not* a specialist.  He keeps the plot moving, and I was riveted.<br/>2. Humor - If you look at the quoted first line, you'll see why this *isn't* a tale straight from SF's golden age.  Weir is hilarious, both in the portions narrated by astronaut Mark Whatley, and also in the sections with Mission Control on Earth.  This *isn't* Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (which I love). The humor is not slapsticky, or goofy, but grows organically from the characters and their interactions.<br/>3. Excellent narration - I got the audio edition, narrated by R. C. Bray.  He has a voice that is perfect for the ""First-Person Singular Smartass"" narration, and does a great job creating a multi-ethnic/national cast for the portions on Earth.  He makes most of them true indiduals, and it was always easy to follow exactly which character was speaking, even in scenes with a crowded office full of people.  Also, he hits the sarcastic and ironic bits of dialogue perfectly - funny, but not making him into the guy you want to punch because he doesn't know how to turn it off.  I know I have praised the humor, but the book is about a literal life and death situation, and the author and narrator make sure the stakes feel very real.<br/><br/>If you enjoy classic adventure stories, with several laugh-out-loud moments, and great attention to scientific detail, check this out.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2C1ZNVF8YEJ4A?ASIN=1491590173	Absolutely unique and remarkable book	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I suppose there is a ""type"" of person who will like this book. I loved it because I like science (but don't know enough of it), I like problem solving, I understand the character, I'm kind an introvert, and I've spent a lot of time alone on boats. I'm positive my automobile-obsessed, deeply mechanical brothers will love it. I'm quite certain my science-writer sister will admire it and think it is very well written but she might tear it apart for purely ""writer's workshop"" kinds of reasons (virtually no viable female characters for example). My wife would hate it because there is only one main character and pretty much all he talks about is the details of his survival on Mars using NASA training to modify NASA-built devices. He's a wise-guy. He rarely gets deeply despondent or reacts in a non-astronaut, non-nerd, anti-rational way (otherwise he would have died).<br/><br/>All that doesn't matter. It's a very, very good, modern Robinson Caruso kind of tale that anyone with a bit of tech in their blood will love. If you learned the science behind everything he does you would have a pretty good start on chemistry, biology, materials science, astrophysics, planet science, electronics, certain kinds of math, and a kind of survival decision-making.<br/><br/>So kudos to Andy Weir. I have no idea who he is or what else he's written but he's done us all a service. I'm deeply impressed that he knows so much science and is confident enough to put it on the line. This is well written and well-edited (especially compared to the usual SciFi dreck). On top of that he is selling it for a dollar and gives permission to pass it on for free. What a guy!</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R284L6OTNPF4G7?ASIN=1491590173	Really wanted to like this book	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">When this book was announced, I put it on my calendar to make sure I didn't forget when it came out. The idea, being stranded on a planet with only your wits for survival, is an excellent story line. But this book seriously lacks character development, as other 2-star raters have said. The book bothered me from the very start. Mark, the main character, seems to have almost no emotional reaction to learning that he's been left on Mars, except for, 'I'm f---ed'. Well, that goes without saying. I would have expected some bit of reflection, like I can't believe it, what I'm going to do, I'm so angry, I'm so sad, whatever. Then he seems to jump right into survival mode like he's been expecting it all along. I've watched nearly all episodes of 'I shouldn't be alive', and I can't remember a single person in a survival situation starting off with complete and immediate acceptance of their situation and quickly developing and executing a survival plan. Even if Mark had said NASA trained astronauts for eventualities like this, he should have still gone through some sort of reaction, then gotten into survival mode, explaining that training said not to waste time dawdling or some such thing. I think I got about 20% into the book and stopped. The amount of detail and repitition that went into just setting up the soil for potatoes became dull as dirt (no pun intended!). Sorry, but I just returned the book.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1OOL2YW1ZFSHG?ASIN=1491590173	Sci Fi Geekdom Rules!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I am skeptical of many sci fi books because the science is so implausible &amp; too often the plots become yet another space opera. Not so with Andy Weir' s debut The Martian. An unlikely hero becomes stranded on Mars &amp; the race for survival is on. The story is told through the journals &amp; communications of the main character &amp; his colleagues, making for an amusing, touching, &amp; page turning read. Funny, suspenseful, and very very real - The Martian does not disappoint. Lots of science &amp; McGyver-ish moments make this geeky action story a hit for just about anyone, although Weir' s characters speak candidly, ie, dropping f bombs when things go bad in a hurry, as most folks do! I couldn't' put this book down &amp; could imagine a great movie being made of this! Highly recommended.</span>"

Great story, great characters and well edited too.  I could hear Mark Whatney's voice as I read the story.  Plus some fantastic humor sprinked in.  Please write more Mr. Weir, you have real talent.  I will pay full list for your stories.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1XSUNIFIDYBTD?ASIN=1491590173	Amazingly good SF novel	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">There aren't many books that I can't put down but this is one of them. It's a real page-turner and I stayed up way too late reading it. For prose addicts like me, this book would be a good way to spend a winter Sunday.<br/><br/>The tone is very upbeat, even though the story is about an astronaut trying to survive after being abandoned on Mars. The scientific angles were very well handled, from the astronaut's Robinson Crusoe-like efforts on Mars to the orbital physics of the rescue operation. For a hard SF fan like me, this was a treat.<br/><br/>The plot was well thought-out and the pacing was excellent. Kudos to Mr. Weir.<br/><br/>One reviewer commented about the F-bomb. There's no shortage of that, though I thought the hero's character was engaging despite (and sometimes *because of*) his frequently profane soliloquies. If the hero's characterization wasn't tempered with a little profanity, it would be hard to take him seriously: he'd be just too upbeat to believe. (IOW, I'd probably be cursing a blue streak if I were in his shoes.)<br/><br/>The other characters were also well drawn. And some of them were equally - but believably - profane.<br/><br/>You never know what you'll find, shopping the Kindle SF section. This book is a real jewel and I recommend it very highly.<br/><br/>I wish I could find more books this good at this price. I'd be a happy addict.</span>"

At times it can be tedious and the main characters use if language is obnoxious. Not referring to profanity but more that the author tries to paint the protagonist as the goofy cool guy, which just gets tiresome.</span>"

4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R20F86TMZ95A9K?ASIN=1491590173	Totally NOT a rant (yep, it's a rant).	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I know there are LOTS of reviews already, so maybe mine will just be added to the sea of voices. However, I feel I should point something out, so here is my rant...er..I mean review<br/><br/>So, after reading this book, which I read faster than any novel I've ever read...I was intrigued by what others might have thought. I for one chalked up my hysterically enthusiastic love for this book to my marsophile way of looking at the world, and y'know me being an engineering student and a super nerd.<br/><br/>Well, I was pleasantly surprised to see so many people did in fact like this book. Wow! People really DO give a sh*t about science! Yay! Ok, so I guess I'm not saying all bad stuff. But I was still frustrated by some of the one-stars.<br/><br/>I found a common trend among most (not all) of the one star reviews. The typical complaints I found were these:<br/>The book is boring/tedious<br/>The book is too technical/""science-y""<br/>The writing is sophomoric/bad/etc<br/>The characters are juvenile/immature<br/>The characters are one-dimensional<br/><br/>Go ahead and look at the one star reviews, and nearly EVERY SINGLE ONE of them says one or more of those exact things.<br/><br/>Why would I be bothered by this? Well I'll start with the most nebulous or difficult to counter complaint and move to the most exacting, or easiest to refute.<br/><br/>""The writing is sophomoric"": Okay, so this one is sort of hard to refute. It's true that this is Andy's first novel, however, he isn't exactly new to writing. I will absolutely agree that his writing has a VERY distinct style to it, and if it just isn't your cup o' tea, it just won't improve. His style is polarizing. I think it's pretty obvious that he still has a lot to learn about writing, but I found his attention to detail, and pacing to actually be pretty darn good. Mostly he did the right thing in that his writing got out of the way of itself. I think a lot of this hinges on the other complaints though. If you found the story too technical or tedious, then clearly it'd be difficult to let the writing get out of the way. In fact, it'd be assaulting you right in the eyeballs in a pretty horrific way, and I think that's how it ended up for a lot of the negative reviewers.<br/><br/>""Too tedious/boring/technical"" This complaint I find to be highly alarming. The technical explanations NEVER exceed anything above high school level. Some of it IS specific, but not that hard to look up. In fact, plenty of ""good writing"" that is well respected tends to push the reader's vocabulary, they have to look words up, or learn new uses for old words. This is NOT uncommon in the world of great literature. Andy has chosen instead to expand the reader's technical vocabulary. And admittedly, your technical understanding SHOULD be at a level high enough to understand this. If it isn't, I'd recommend reading it, looking up what you don't understand, and reading it again. If this book is too technical for you, then your education has failed you, so do better! This is like complaining that a race car is hard to drive. Well, yeah, of course it is if you don't know how to drive one, driving a passenger car is hardly sufficient enough skill to operate a race car. Same principle here.<br/><br/>""one-dimensional/juvenile/immature characters"" I find this to be most disturbing of all. If you GENUINELY feel that these people, especially Whatney behaves in a unrealistic way, then I feel VERY sorry for people who interact with you. I was surprised by the depth of the character study done here. I personally resonated with Whatney! My wife went as far as to say that he talks just like me! So of course, I suppose that means many of you one-star reviewers would write me off as juvenile. Yikes. Spoiler: different people have different personalities. Mark Whatney is a CLASSIC ""INTP"". If you don't know what an INTP is, then google it and read it. You'll notice Mark behaves VERY similarly. In fact, I'd go as far to say that Andy himself might have this personality type, which lends itself well to injecting such passion into the main character, and bleeds through into the writing style itself.<br/><br/>Look, this is a FANTASTIC book. If you are really into the space colonization thing, aerospace industry, survival stories, mars stories, and you have a decent enough technical background (or don't mind learning what you don't know) then this is probably a book you will want to read. I think a willingness to be open to both people and details are needed to fully appreciate this novel.<br/><br/>Not all the negative reviews are bad, some have pretty valid points about Andy's amateur status. But overall, the majority of the negative reviews should be shunned due to their intolerance of those personalities that fail to match their social standards, and/or general lack of technical competency.<br/><br/>I can sum up who should NOT buy this book:<br/>The stupid people who can't see the point of math after highschool (how is your retirement account coming along? lots of numbers, right?)<br/>The vapid self-centered people who think they're type of personhood and worldview is the only one that matters<br/>OR The person who is a rather competent reader who just happens to not be into this kind of story.<br/><br/>But for almost anyone else who is interested, you already know you are, so just buy the darn thing already. And if you're offended by anything I said in this review...well, you won't be able to handle Mark Whatney, so you might as well NOT buy it.</span>"

"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I finished The Martian last night and it left me gasping.<br/>The character of Watley was complex, I mean his psych evaluation said that when he gets stressed, he cracks jokes. The humour in the dire situation was laugh out loud funny at times.<br/>We know that astronauts drill for worst case scenarios - and this book reads like a showcase of nothing but. The survival of each new disaster was believable and left me feeling more connected with the daily struggle. When the earth based side of the story started, it sent the story in a new direction and became less like a single POV diary (which would have gotten really dull) and became a totally absorbing action adventure.<br/>I hope the film comes close to capturing the humanity, the humour and the essence of this great story.</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZE8SBOZYSWGB?ASIN=1491590173	Out of this world	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Really only $.99 for an epic adventure to the red planet. If you ever wanted survival training adventure out of this world look no further. This tale is told from both perspectives of the lone abandoned astronaut without a chance to live clinging on to every scrap of hope and from Earth and how mission control and the media perceives his situation. I appreciated how frank and candid NASA administrators are probably since everyone could die in seconds there is no reason to beat around the bush.  The wit is exceptionally humorous and the jokes hit every funny bone in my skeleton. Could almost feel what it would be like to live in a spacesuit and gasp for every breath while counting down the final seconds to lift off. Get ready for a blast with this space adventure!</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RLYY7GMHJLTA6?ASIN=1491590173	"""Are you out of your ******* mind?"""	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Mark Watney is one of the most engaging characters I've had the pleasure to read in a very long time.  This is an amazing book.  I have no idea how technically accurate it is, and I could care less.  The author (bless you Mr. Weir) created a never say die character with an awesome sense of comedic timing. :)  There is a bit of profanity in the book.  Guess what, real people, they curse when in stressful, life-threatening and/or unexpected situations.  I read, a LOT.  The dialogue in this book was done very well.  Especially considering the gentlemen was alone, on Mars, with ZERO communication with anyone for the vast majority of the book.  Freaking great book.  Can't say it enough.  Very well done Andy Weir!</span>"

I quite liked the storyline, but really, it reads like it was written by a teenager or someone without the acuity to explore characters. Very shallow, full of mildly interesting sciencey guff. I didn't find it gripping.<br/><br/>For once, I actually think the movie will be better than the book.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3CZWTQQXSE6BG?ASIN=1491590173	Extremely entertaining story!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">A definite winner here, the raw and unfiltered main character, astronaut Mark Watney, guides you through his survival story, via log entries, on the surface of Mars.  Interspersed throughout problem-solving, technical and scientific jargon is the character's interesting takes on the situation at hand, and we get to see what goes through his mind during critical situations.  An unlikely, but nonetheless enjoyable, sequence of events takes the reader along on a journey with Mark, who impresses with his knowledge as well as his humor.  Having the ability to connect with this likable character really made this a page turner.  Well done, Mr. Weir!</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RUGFDOM3LFN1X?ASIN=1491590173	Good Crusoe Like Read...	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Hundreds of reviews on this book. Would have given it 4 stars if some of the minutiae was less filling, and if there had a been an Epilogue about his return to Earth. Character is a bit thin, very fortuitous/Pollyanna like, and not quite as fulfilling as it could have been, imo.  The multi-nation rescue is a bit over the top, (in terms of capabilities even in the next couple decades), and the harsh language seemed almost 'inserted' for effect vs how people really swear to themselves.  Good Read, though.<br/>My 50Cts...<br/>GL, Ol'UncleMotor</span>"

I have just gotten into Mars sci-fi stories and picked this up on a random reccomendation.  I am so glad that I did.  The author does an excellent job with everything, but what struck me as the most wonderful was resourcefullness of the main character.  I stayed up way too late two nights in a row, draining my Kindle battery to finish it.  I hope to see more from this author soon.<br/>Just a side note, there were many laugh out lound funny parts without taking away from the tension of the story.</span>"

After reading countless positive reviews e-v-e-r-y-w-h-e-r-e on the net I picked up a copy and was immediately disappointed. As a grown man I felt as if I were reading a story written for 'boys life' magazine. The narrative was completely incongruous and insulting to the perspective of someone trapped on Mars documenting their tale. You also find yourself thinking aloud ""Thank you Captain Obvious"" every other page. It's honestly as if Weir read too many B sci-fi novels growing up and decided to try his hand at writing - it's painful. Instead of convincing the reader, instead of entertaining the reader, instead of interesting the reader in scientific insight we are fed a constant stream of ""this does that, so I did this with that, then this happened and I made this with that"". No wonder it appealed to the geek crowd of 'shut-ins' neurotically tinkering away stranded in their own world of isolation. No wonder Hollywood is making this lowest-common-denominator book into a lowest-common-denominator movie. I'm ashamed for publishing that no one has come forward to criticize this book more widely.</span>"

I love Sci-Fi, but the genre is getting a bit worn out with bad stories and social engineering.<br/><br/>Weir's book has emotion and action, and it is easy for the reader to suspend disbelief.  The story becomes real and it is hard to find places to stop reading.  The science involved is believable.  I have a strong background in physics and chemistry, but I'm not going to push the envelope and try and see if there are errors.  The story was amazingly believable.  I thought the sand storm near the end might be the end of the book.<br/><br/>In many books where there is a lot of emotion, you tell yourself, ""This is just a book.  The hero always survives, right?""  Throughout, I was never certain how the book would end and I won't spoil the ending, but towards the end I was with billions of people of Earth rooting for the outcome I wanted.<br/><br/>I read a lot of books (several a week), and it was such a please to find an inexpensive book that made reading pleasurable again.</span>"

Andy Weir is someone I'll be keeping an eye out for;  The Martian was smart, exciting, and best of all, believably written.

With just 70's sitcoms and the horrors of Disco to accompany him he sets out to accomplish the impossible, to go home.....and to not ever eat another potato.<br/><br/>I am always wary of reviews that are all consistently good but I do not think you will see a bad review of this book. If there is, it is because they hate Hard Science Fiction, or they are humourless or more probably both, I mean who does not like Hard Science Fiction right? This is the best 99c I have ever spent. You may be sceptical beforehand but 1 chapter will be enough to convince you this book is worth every cent. It is well written, well edited, funny, sad, gross and a great adventure from beginning to end.</span>"

The protagonist is stuck on Mars and I think he mentioned once that he missed his mother.  It was just bizarre. He was stuck on MARS.  No thoughts on life or death, relationships, regrets, nothing.  Although he did say he would buy someone a beer if he got off the planet.  It was just one predictable disaster after another with him using his MacGyver skills to survive intertwined with sarcastic jokes.  The only reason I finished was because I paid for the book and I'm cheap.  If you are a science fiction fan this will not scratch that itch. No aliens; no time debt; no original and imaginative technologies; no discussion on politics, religion, or philosophy; nothing. You want a good Scifi book, read Hyperion by Dan Simmons.</span>"

4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1V3BAQ02QFVYO?ASIN=1491590173	Oh the Martianity	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I only just heard of this book when seeing the movie preview recently and coincidentally heard someone raving about it on a podcast that I like in the same few days so thought I would check it out.  I am glad I did, as it was an interesting and very quick read, but from a literary standpoint was definitely lacking some elements that make a novel truly engaging and memorable.  I am surprised to see almost 13000 reader reviews on this and, like most popular fiction, think it is a bit overrated on Amazon with so many 5 star reviews, but I will add my 3 star review to the mix.  It doesn't mean the book was not enjoyable, but it was no 5-star level novel either.<br/><br/>The novel is a tale of survival of astronaut Mark Watney who has an accident while his astronaut crew are making an emergency departure of Mars. He is presumed dead and left behind.  He is in a pretty dire situation, but uses his resourcefulness and materials at hand to extend his survival time until he can hopefully be rescued.<br/><br/>The good things about this book are fairly numerous.  It has an upbeat, positive vibe throughout which is a nice thing to have in a novel that could be pretty grim. The overall message is that humanity is not really bad and wants to help each other out.  Weir's writing style is extremely similar to Ernest Cline (Ready Player One).  Lots of exposition and geeky details added in for fun.  I really enjoyed the  science and technical details of how Watney created viable soil for crops and modified the equipment at hand to extend his survival and try to communicate with NASA.  I had flashbacks to math and physics classes where we had to do word problems in enclosed systems.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the ""bad"" aspects of this book.  I admit I skimmed through a lot of the math once I got the concept of what Watney was trying to do.  It is not always interesting to read through arithmetic, and there is a lot of it in this novel.  Also, characterization almost doesn't exist.  Watney shows no depth of character.  He never despairs,  never contemplates the landscape around him, even when driving through previously unexplored areas of Mars.  He simply solves problems as they arise, and then makes a joke about it.  Most of the book is given in the form of his logbook, so that sort of makes sense that he would try to leave a positive image of himself for posterity, but the book suffers for it.  All of the characters given any time in the novel show the same range of emotions as Watney.  Astronauts are brave and jokey.  NASA officials are hard-working and jokey.  The media response to the incident also didn't seem realistic at times.  The media-relations character for NASA at one time insists on getting a photo of Watney on Mars which was impossible since he would have to be in his suit when he is in front of the satellites, but she keeps shrieking about it anyways.  NASA should fire that person and get someone with common sense.<br/><br/>Anyways, the book is totally worth reading but is not a classic to be read over and over again.  I will probably see the movie when it is released as I think there are elements which would translate better on screen.  Good summer reading material for sure.</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3KSFQCWGYRLKX?ASIN=1491590173	Soon, you too will be endorsing this title with zeal	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">My reading horizons consist of Paranormal, Paranormal, and more Paranormal. So, when another reviewer fervently recommended this SciFi audiobook to me, I was skeptical. However, past experience has taught me not to ignore my fellow bloggers, and that served me well once again because THE MARTIAN was outstanding! This genre isn’t my forte, and Math was always my weakest subject in school, but pair them with Andy Weir’s writing &amp; R.C. Bray’s narration, and soon you too will be endorsing this title with zeal.<br/><br/>This story is told via a series of log entries from Mark Watney’s POV, with intermittent JPL/NASA, Hermes, etc narratives. It was funny, dire, hopeful, scientific, and so much more. The protagonist makes good use of his mechanical engineering &amp; botanist background which lead to a lot of technical jargon that even laymen like me could appreciate. The hero’s fight for survival was one that every human can relate to, and his ability to laugh in the face of adversity was oftentimes the difference between life &amp; death.<br/><br/>You’d think that a novel that’s restricted to a habitat, a rover, and a deserted planet as locales, and one character all by his lonesome would get tedious in the long run, but if you’re Weir that’s all you need. Mark Watney made this book for me with his sarcastic sense of humour, and MacGyver-like ingenuity. His last name really should have been Murphy because anything that can go wrong, will—at the worst possible moment. From magic duct tape, to pondering the accurateness of Aquaman, to solving terminal velocity à la Iron Man; you will fall in love with Watney.<br/><br/>I can’t say with utmost certainty, but I’m 99.9% positive that the calculations would have bored me to tears if it weren’t for R.C. Bray’s enthusiastic performance. The protagonist celebrates victories with yays, and setbacks with boos, and those emotions came through loud and clear in Bray’s tone. Saving Mark eventually became a world-wide effort, and as a result, the narrator had to cycle through tons of accents including Hindu, German &amp; Chinese, and he aced them all. Unless you’re a whiz, I’d recommend listening over reading to most.<br/><br/>THE MARTIAN was passed on to me, and now it’s my turn to do the same for you. You’re welcome.</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2DMQ3D3U7USBO?ASIN=1491590173	Good, Not Great	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">If you enjoy ‘realistic’ science fiction--meaning a setting using near-term science as we currently understand it, as opposed to far-future aliens and space opera--and if the use of the ‘f’ word is your favorite means of expression, you may really like “The Martian.” I enjoyed it, though not nearly as much as the majority of reviewers here, who seemed eager to have handed out top accolades. Perhaps that’s just a reaction to the mountains of garbage that normally fill up genre fiction, and I understand praising a book that’s trying to be better than that, but I can’t give it a perfect score. I listened to the MP3 CD version of the story, which was very well performed, produced, and packaged. As for the story itself, the author seems to have wanted to write a ‘future-decade Apollo 13’ novel. While the story is brimming with technical details to sate hard science fiction fans, I found it wanting in basic ways. For one thing, there’s no character arc at all. The main character is the same person on the last page as he is on the first. I kept hoping the story would explore what happens to a person’s mental state after being trapped for so long in such a lonely, hostile environment. Would he become despondent? Philosophical? Angry? Our narrator here doesn’t change, presumably because he is ‘so well trained.’ There’s a general lack of drama in this story, in part because of the way the author chose to tell it--through journal entries. So even if there were exciting emotional moments, they passed by in-between the pages. One paragraph may say, “I’m going to try this…” and the next paragraph is two days later: “Well yesterday was a bad day…” and then the narrator launches into some techno-babble that is forgivable only because it is ostensibly based in real science. But we don’t actually get to *live* that that moment. So the story ends up being a fairly monotonous, evenly-paced sequence of disasters and solutions, and the solutions come across as very ‘writerly,’ an attempt to recapture those great ‘triumph of the nerds’ moments from the film Apollo 13. Supposedly a film is now being made of *this* story… I can’t imagine how since the solutions to all the problems encountered require pages of scientific explanation about how to extract hydrogen from rocket fuel and so on, but maybe the film will actually show us things happening instead of reading post-facto log entries, and perhaps seeing an actor actually looking terrified or jubilant will provide some human element that I don’t feel comes across in the book, even when it’s being read by a talented performer as it is on the audiobook version. Again, I think the author was going for “smart people in a bad situation solve impossible problems,” which is wonderful, but to be a really good book, you need to have the character pass through an experience and be changed in some way, and that didn’t come across for me at all. The events of Apollo 13 happened over a span of days, but the mission in this book is years in length, and a person would certainly change in such circumstances over such a period. That doesn’t happen here. So it’s an enjoyable story on one level, especially for the scientifically educated, but not a “great” novel. I do think the awesome realities of space exploration—the immense times and distances, and dollars involved--are fertile ground for taught drama, but stories like Godwin’s “Cold Equations” found a better balance between the hard facts of the science and using these to frame a human story. Just solving a seemingly endless stream of science problems isn’t as satisfying as living through the experience through a dimensional character.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2Z5ACKWHH5TWA?ASIN=1491590173	I'm normally a romance reader, but...	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This is definitely not remotely a romance. The vast majority of the time this novel focuses on one solitary man. Now that I have that out of the way, on to the review. I picked this up because it was the only Goodreads Choice Award Winner that piqued my interest. It was outside of my normal bailiwick, but I do enjoy the occasional science fiction story, so I figured why not. And I am so incredibly glad I did. Some of the thrill was probably just the palate cleansing effect of reading :shudders: NOT ROMANCE. But, I think most of the effect was the fact that this is a legitimately good and interesting book. It is commonly described as ""Apollo 13 meets Cast Away"", which if that makes you want to read it I say go for it, but if it doesn't, well I think that is actually a horrible description. Mine? Mark Watney is Q from James bond meets MacGyver... ON MARS! He is hilarious, with this irrepressible spirit, and he has this incredibly smart/sexy thing happening and he survives everything Mars has to throw at him with intelligence, science, and creativity. Honestly, I'd love to hang out with him in person, maybe stand him for a beer, and have his babies. Wait, that just slipped out, so maybe this is a romance...mine.<br/><br/>Just for fun, here are some of my favorite quotes:<br/><br/>""My a$$---- is doing as much to keep me alive as my brain.<br/><br/>""I'm the King of Mars.""<br/><br/>""I don't want to come off as arrogant here, but I'm the best botanist on the planet.""<br/><br/>""Yes, of course duct tape works in a near vacuum. Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshipped.""<br/><br/>""I'll call it a ""pirate-ninja.""<br/><br/>""As with most of life's problems, this one can be solved by a box of pure radiation.""<br/><br/>""You're sending him to space under a tarp?""<br/><br/>""...apparently, I smell like a skunk took a s--- on some sweat socks. This is the happiest day of my life.""</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3H8TDDGZNK40E?ASIN=1491590173	Incredible. Could not put this book down.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Curse you Andy Weir. Seriously. Your fault: I hardly slept last night. I could not—could not!—put your book down. It was too good.<br/><br/>I loved Chris Hadfield’s ASTRONAUT’S GUIDE TO LIFE ON EARTH, and when a commander of the International Space Station praises a book for “fascinating technical accuracy”, it makes my internal ears perk up. My interest is piqued. Then, the author of WOOL (who sold like a billion copies of his independently published work before getting professionally bound) said, “The best book I've read in ages. Clear your schedule before you crack the seal.” I should have listened. Nope. And there went my night.<br/><br/>Here’s the mix: science and galley humor. With one of the best opening lines ever (censors prevent me from posting it; look it up on Amazon’s preview) and with the stranded astronaut/science guy trying to survive in his “Little Hab on the Prairie”—I’m slayed. Mark Waney, the protagonist, says, “I suppose I’ll think of something. Or die.” And so while he’s recording his journal entries, the earth is watching in fascination and desperate hope.<br/><br/>Incredible would not be the right word for this. If Tom Hank’s Castaway Island was located on Mars and MacGyver was sent as the strandee, then this is what you get. Take a bunch of science—engineering, botany, chemistry (explosive at times)—and tie it together with math, and holy cow! Trust me, even if you aren’t scientific by nature, this is written in an exciting manner that zips by. Did I mention hard to put down?<br/><br/>Despite the sagacious humor, science, and adventure, I like the encompassing lesson: “every human being has a basic instinct to help each other out.”<br/><br/>Thanks to Crown and Random House for sending me this book to review—it was awesome! And I don’t say that lightly. I received this book for free from Blogging for Books for this review.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3P6WH9JVDC8SG?ASIN=1491590173	Destined to be a sci-fi classic. Well done, Mr Weir	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">THE MARTIAN is headed for the bestseller list, I have no doubt. It is so deliciously readable that it is nearly impossible to put down. And here's the weird thing. Usually I HATE science fiction. And Andy Weir's first novel definitely falls into that category with its fascinating tale of Mark Watney, an American astronaut marooned on Mars. And there is plenty of science here, as Watney, like a resourceful shade-tree mechanic with a box of tools and a roll of duct tape, methodically dopes out various problems and somehow keeps solving them, his very survival at stake. Weir is an author who understands the techno-scientific stuff he is writing about, but he writes in a way that makes you get it, and he knows when to let up on the science and inject some comic relief. And THAT, I think, is an absolutely key ingredient in this finely crafted novel: HUMOR. Weir obviously get this, and he is a very funny guy.<br/><br/>There are other characters here. All the staff of NASA back on earth, the other members of the Mars probe crew, and even some scientists from the China space program. Because the whole world is watching as all these experts try to figure out how to rescue Watney. And Weir's sense of humor and knowledge of human behavior works well with these other characters too - the Asperger-ish astrodynamicist Rich Purcell, who comes up with a plan; top manager Teddy, an OCD neat-freak constantly squaring things up, always prepared with a blue folder or red folder filled with his prepared statements; and even a foul-mouthed lady public relations officer. I mean there are some great characters here, and Watney, of course, is the best one.<br/><br/>I kept thinking of ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" as I read Weir's story. And I never even saw that film. And, when it came to his fellow crew members, who wanted to help rescue Mark, I thought of ""Mutiny on the Bounty,"" and even the Donner Party, as they formulated their own desperate plan for survival. Weir also makes good use of humorous references to TV shows and music from the 70s throughout the narrative, even to picking, as his own theme song, ""Stayin' Alive"" by the Bee Gees. Which is most apt, as Watney's situation becomes increasingly desperate in his race to survive, which culminates in a nail-biting conclusion.<br/><br/>THE MARTIAN is, quite simply, a great read, eminently accessible, and not just to sci-fi fans, but to anyone who enjoys fine story telling. Not since Heinlein has a science-fiction novel been so reader-friendly. In fact, this book is good enough to become a sci-fi classic that will be read for years to come. Well done, Mr. Weir.<br/><br/>- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir, BOOKLOVER</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RHI1BZB725ABD?ASIN=1491590173	Slow start, but couldn't put it down!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">The Martian begins as a series of journal entries of Mark Watney, one of 6 astronauts sent to Mars on an expedition, sometime in the indistinct future, by NASA.<br/><br/>In the course of a massive Martian dust storm which threatens the integrity of the MAV (Mars Ascent Vehicle), the crew must make it's way to the vehicle and make an emergency departure from the planet. In the course of doing so, flying debris coupled with near zero visibility severely injures Watney, and his life support system's telemetry indicates death. This results in his being left behind, thought to be a dead man by the remaining crew of the expedition.<br/><br/>A piece of radio antenna has breached the suit, but bleeding and resulting coagulation , along with the suit's remarkable emergency systems, has prevented his breathable air supply form escaping. After regaining consciousness, he manages to return through the airlock of the ""hab: module and beginning self first aid.<br/><br/>After recovery from his accident, he realizes that he's left alone on Mars as a castaway; thus begins his remarkable tale of dealing with adversity and coping with his fate.<br/><br/>The selection process of the Mars explorers made a great choice with Watney; not a quitter, talented, very bright and innovative, Watney begins his preparations for long term survival and awaiting the next mission to Mars by NASA--in several years!<br/><br/>I don't want to belabor the details in this review-not-a-synopsis, but I'll state here that it's a techno-nerd's delight. I was almost ready to put it down until the switch of operations involving NASA came along in another early chapter, wherein one of the Mars satellite techs realized Watney was still alive and making efforts to survive. At that point, the level of excitement and spirit of adventure kicks in, grabbing the reader's attention.<br/><br/>Five stars for a number of reasons: besides the gripping tale of survival, and the unquenched human spirit of the protagonist, the overall technical accuracy of what he was up against  and how  a proposed Mars mission would be undertaken is spot-on by reference to Robert Zubrin's book: The Case for Mars.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3M16L0R7JZ032?ASIN=1491590173	Best bargain of 2012?!  Keep on writing, Andy, please!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Now that I've had my Kindle for a good long while I've got my reader's rhythm going.  I keep a tight budget, LOVE to read, and especially love to read new authors and outside my comfort zone.  Prior to my Kindle the tight budget was kept largely by utilizing my local library.  Unfortunately, I'm in small town rural area and the library system is severely lacking in breadth and depth.<br/><br/>So, what does this have to do with ""The Martian,"" you ask?  Kindle's awesome, fabulous ""sample"" option, especially combined with bargain-priced and free books lets me search the written universe for hitherto unknown authors.  I load hundreds of samples each month and whiz through them looking for hidden treasure.<br/><br/>If I read the sample and cannot wait a single solitary minute longer to see what happens, that book is a buy, regardless of price.  This doesn't happen often, so I like to take time to review the books that capture me and my dollars.<br/><br/>The Martian was one of those books.  I ate this book up in two sittings, and would have been one had I not started it at midnight.  Imagine my surprise and delight to find it was only .99!  I'm still trying to figure out whose writing style Weir is reminiscent of, but it hasn't come to me.  And I like it a lot.  Next to Hugh Howey's Wool series, this is my favorite surprise book of 2012.<br/><br/>What is so odd is that I loved everything about this book when I absolutely shouldn't have.  I don't care much for gratuitous profanity and this book is liberally laced with it.  I don't like my sci fi so ""fi"" that it is absolutely unbelievable, yet I loved this book and it's completely implausible hero and his journey--mythic, epic completely wonderfully unbelievable yet gripping!  I absolutely do not like my sci fi heavily loaded with too much techy ""sci"" either.  I don't care for lots of technical jargon, but I love some nice clean science.  Weir made the science and engineering feats totally engrossing and I actually read every word instead of glossing over the minutiae.  I don't care if it's real (yet), it felt real to me as I read the book.<br/><br/>As I write this I realize that frequently during the book I considered that if my husband the mechanical engineer, mr. fixit extraordinaire were abandoned in the same scenario, he would have extremely good odds of surviving (and without a single curse word for bonus points).  So perhaps that is why the story really spoke to me?<br/><br/>I encourage anyone who likes scifi/fantasy to splurge .99 and get this great book.  I genuinely hope the author is hard at work on his next book because I am so ready to read it.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1C70JI7ALNO76?ASIN=1491590173	Extreme Tourism	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Quite a few people who saw me reading 'The Martian' couldn't stop ranting and raving about Mr. Weir's novel. Maybe their enthusiasm boosted my expectations to unrealistic levels because I thought the book was just okay. The author loves science and describes in very specific detail what Mark Watney did to solve problems in order to survive. For readers who like knowing how the stranded astronaut jerry-rigged this doohickey and that doohickey to keep alive, you'll find 'The Martian' a big treat. I, however, almost gave up on the book after the first fifty pages because so much techie talk was starting to make my eyes glaze over. Once Mr. Weir introduced the perspectives of NASA employees and the Mars flight crew who left Watney behind, the novel became more interesting.<br/><br/>The book is a celebration of science, creative know-how and courage in order to try saving the stranded astronaut. There's no little green men or The Force between the covers of this thing. What you get is a realistic representation of the demands of surviving on Mars. It was difficult for me to rate 'The Martian' because I went through periods of being very absorbed by the story and, other times, drifting into boredom when ole Watney started describing how he was solving a problem even if it was a life-and-death situation. Watney is a very likable character and has quite a few sarcastic lines that made me smile. My guess is if you're geeky (which isn't a bad thing), you'll love 'The Martian'. I can also see why Hollywood snapped the book up and made a movie starring Matt Damon as Mark Watney. Heck, if I had been the main character and stranded on Mars, I would've wet and soiled my spacesuit and been dead within the first few pages.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2CZ94W84UVXJ7?ASIN=1491590173	Very realistic and gripping story.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Other reviewers have provided a synopsis of this book, but I have to chime in to say that it is one of the best hard SF books I've read in quite a while.<br/><br/>The story of a sort of Martian Robinson Crusoe, all alone trying to survive in a indifferent and extremely hostile environment is gripping stuff. There is little ""action"". Things happen slowly with ocassionaly moments of excitement/terror when things rapidly go wrong. Yet the tension builds and the solutions to the problems are both innovative technically and demonstrative of a straightforward engineering and scientific approach to problem solving.<br/><br/>The character simply doesn't give up. He demonstrates resiliance and good humour throughout. It's the sort of story that would, in real life, glue people to their screens every day looking for updates. The main character is both likeable and engaging, with a sense of humour and independance that is refreshing to find in any book.<br/><br/>Working in the space industry I have met these people and been in meetings where similar attitudes are demonstrated. It rings very, very true and is a testament to an author who either has personal experience in the space indsutry or has done an admirable amount of research and then managed to write all of those characters &amp; situations accurately and in a way that draws you into the story.<br/><br/>Very, very well done. Highly recommended to hard SF fans.</span>"

Nope, wrong, ...there was no such important info!  All of that reading, and reading some pretty difficult calculations and equations, and all of it for nothing.

The central character Mark Watney is witty and amusing and I was laughing out loud frequently while reading this book.  I particularly enjoyed candid contemporary language that gave the entire narrative a gritty credible reality.  It is unusual to find a book where all of the characters swear and curse just like normal people do and it adds a delightful layer of verisimilitude.<br/><br/> I only have one very minor pet peeve where the author got some of his science wrong.  There is a situation where the Chinese supply ship is docking with the American interplanetary craft, and the supply ship is approaching at 2 meters per second from 60 meter range.  In final approach it is still going at .9 m/s.  This would be an absolute disaster for two multiple ton spacecraft!  I think he got his speeds off by three decimal places!  Somehow this glaring error really sticks out in my memory despite all the other excellent science and humor.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R20HF56KZCTV2A?ASIN=1491590173	NOT only for SciFi lovers...excellent!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I thought this novel was fantastic!  We picked it for our book club and I was wondering what I would think of it since we don't read a lot of sci fi.  But I thoroughly enjoyed it and I don't even know if I'd call it sci fi.  It was just a story...a very well written story...about a rescue attempt and the better virtues of mankind...just happened to take place in space.  I fell in love with the characters; they were very well developed.  Andy Weir was very knowledgeable about the technical parts in this novel (there were many) and that made the novel believable.  Can't say enough good things about it.  I read this on my kindle but I'm buying the hard copy to keep in my ""favorites"" library.  It's hard to make my ""favorites"" library..I'm very picky.  Only warning is there is some language in the novel that may be offensive if you are bothered by that sort of thing (use of the four letter word).  I however, am not offended by language and felt that it added to the personality of the main character..who made me laugh.  Great novel!</span>"

"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">The writing can be amateurish sometimes, and the whole book in general could use editing, however I loved every minute of it! Andy Weir is a great writer, I never wanted to stop reading. I really connected with the main character, and there were laughs to be had throughout. <br/><br/>Give it a chance, this book has inspired me to read more. I'm just sad the adventure is over!</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R28FKF3JT5DVXO?ASIN=1491590173	In my opinion you will not find a better thriller set on Mars or elsewhere	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">NASA has set up a chain of expeditions to Mars but very soon after landing the third one is aborted and the scientists have to leave. Unknown to them their dead companion, who is not actually dead, finds himself stranded on Mars with little hope of surviving until the next scheduled mission. Air and water are not the problem but he does not have enough food despite being left with the resources to accommodate six explorers.<br/><br/>Right from the start this is a gripping page-turner and no matter how hard Mark Watney strives to survive Mars works just as hard to kill him. All the time I was willing him to succeed only to have yet another believable crisis threatening his continued existence. In my opinion you will not find a better thriller set on Mars or elsewhere. I had not previously heard of the author and cannot remember how I ended up buying his book to read on my Ipad, but it was a good day. Highly recommended, excellent value for money, and I look forward to reading other work from Weir.</span>"

"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">From the review on Kirkus I thought the premise of this book was imaginative and fun.

3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3L2F1CH44TE6I?ASIN=1491590173	Take that, Jon Carter!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Probably one of the most enjoyable ""hard"" science fiction books I have ever read. Mr. Weir actually makes lengthy technical and engineering details well, riveting. And he does it with a great deal of campy humor that makes this a very human story, not just a technological thriller. There are excellent psychological overlays, and one gets to know not only the primary character but many others quite well. Not that many books I have read have managed to be exciting in the page-turner sense, thoughtful, irreverent and a real hoot at the same time. ""The Martian"" truly does. Do yourself a favor and buy this book. You will be glad you did, unless you have an utter abhorrence of space, technology, and lame (but wonderful) jokes.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RIT69LRPUCT4Z?ASIN=1491590173	A Fun Read, But Not A Great Book	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Given the more than 2,000 other reviews of this book, I realized that mine is utterly inconsequential.  That said, I review everything I read and every recording I listen to, so I'm not going to let a lack of consequence dissuade me from posting a review.<br/><br/>The ginormous buzz that this book has been getting led me to expect that it was more than a mere escapist (literally, I suppose) read.  I should have followed my wife's advice to keep expectations low to avoid being disappointed.  I mean, there's nothing really wrong with the book, but it's nothing more than a 21st-century reprise of something that's been done SO many times before - think Gilligan's Island in space.  In other words, it has the standard level of drama of someone marooned on a desert island (or in this case a desert planet) with no hope of getting back alive and no resources other than his own ingenuity.  It more than meets the standard requirements for that genre, such as a witty and fatalistic narrator and a customary degree of suspense as to whether or not he'll make it.  So it's a fun read, and generally an easy one - at least so long as one doesn't try to parse, much less understand, all the technical mumbo-jumbo of the space age.  But that's all it is.  And, for me at least, if I'd seriously tried to understand all the mumbo-jumbo it would have been a profound bore (I think).<br/><br/>So it's great for a flight or a weekend read, but not a whole lot more.  Too bad - I wish it had been a contender!</span>"

I can't believe this is Andy Weir's first novel.  This is writing at its' best and then some.  Gripping, totally believable storyline, strong characters that will keep you turning the pages until you have read the whole thing.<br/><br/>The personalities of the characters make you feel like you know them and you feel for them through out the book.  Some have hard decisions to make but you understand why they are making them.  What Whatney goes through is so unbelievably amazing as well as those on the return capsule and those on Earth, trying to get all of them back alive and in one piece.<br/><br/>If you want to read a book that has thrills, humor, drama and adventure, then The Martian is for you.  You will not be disappointed!!</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1VJR5ZL6F0NVG?ASIN=1491590173	great macgyver story	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Believable characters, strong story line, and a great interweaving of real science. Weir does a wonderful job of detailing hard science without sacrificing dramatic tension. By structuring the bulk of the book as the protagonist's log, the author provides the intimacy of a first person viewpoint while maintaing a taut narrative--the character, by necessity, must spend long periods of time thinking and working, and the mechanism of the log enables the author to shorten those time periods while keeping the reader engaged.<br/><br/>The first thing I did upon finishing the book was to see if Weir had written anything else, but apparently not. If this is, in fact, his first novel, I'm doubly impressed and I eagerly await his next one.</span>"
4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R712U1O8E40LT?ASIN=1491590173	Great Read - Enough Science to Make it Plausible	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This book is set in the near future when mankind is on its 3rd trip to the Red Planet.  The main character gets trapped on Mars with little chance of survival.  Needless to say, he endures many hardships and the ending is in doubt all the way.  The book is well written and really echoes the Apollo 13 crisis from 1970.  You really begin to root for him as the book invests you in his survival.  If there is one knock on the book, some of the ancillary characters are not well developed and a little unbelievable - though the author obviously made a conscious decision to make it 500 pages of fast paced action rather than bore you with character development.  You cannot go wrong reading the book - It is a really quick read.</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R9S6M3QL0J4H8?ASIN=1491590173	Fun science, boring emotions.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Started off pretty excited about this. Then I began to realize the humanity was lacking. Kind of robotic actually, just a dude with a preternatural ability to solve problems. Occasionally he expresses emotion. Other people also occasionally express emotion. Basically it's science porn. The ending gives this away; it's super anti-climactic. I won't give it away, just to say all the problems are solved (one way or another) and then... it's just over. No (or very little) reflection on what had happened beyond, ""Yay, human beings can solve problems with science!"" It just ends. Anyway, my guess is the upcoming movie will backfill in the emotion and meaning that is lacking in the book and tone down the science.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RR01HW5CUE23D?ASIN=1491590173	wow!  an amazing book.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I was skeptical at first -- the title conjured up images of green men.  But boy was I glad to have gotten over that skepticism.  To me, this is really about ingenuity -- in this case, how to survive on Mars with limited equipment.  It is a book about problem solving .... The ability to stay calm and focused in trying circumstances and ruthlessly apply logic and science to optimize a complex survival equation.  If you're into this kind of thing, you're going to love this book.<br/><br/>One thing this book does not do is delve into the psychological aspects of prolonged isolation on another planet.  Frankly, I was glad it didn't.  It stuck to its knitting without pretending to be a psychological exegesis.</span>"

The engaging and light hearted way this is written doesn't trivialise the plot nor distract from the plight of our primary character, Astronaut Mark Watney, botanist, optimist and enthusiast engineer.<br/><br/>He is wounded, lost in a dust storm, suffers failure of equipment and the fundamental problems that no one knows he is alive.  A rescue is over a year away, and he will starve to death in a third of that time...  But that isn't going to stop him from trying.</span>"

And as hard as authors try to be realistic and science based even the greats usually have to fudge or use soap opera writing to create drama. This book doesnt. The humor, the realism, the adventure, the creativity in this book make it one of the best books i have ever read. Usually the price of audiobooks stick in my craw.

5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2H6IDN15ZD62M?ASIN=1491590173	Outstanding doesn't even come close	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I've been a Casey Weir fan since the days of the old Casey and Andy webcomic.  This is his first novel and he hit it out of the park.<br/><br/>Abandoned on Mars with nothing but parts to salvage, smarts, ingenuity....and duct tape.  This is where Mark Watney finds himself after an unexpected surface storm causes the Mars mission he was on to abort unexpectedly.  What does he need to do to survive?<br/><br/>This is an old-fashioned, hard-science fiction novel a la Isaac Asimov and the early SF writers.  But Weir writes the hard science in such a way that a goober like me can understand it, buy into it and believe it.  Kudos, Andy - great job.  And you didn't even need the devil as your girlfriend to succeed with it!</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R37V3ZNYP14MPV?ASIN=1491590173	More math than a story here.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I trudged through 40% of this one before finally putting it down for good. Based off of the many reviews, I was optimistic going into this novel, but the lack of character development and plot made for a dull read that ultimately couldn't hold my interest. I was eager to delve into the mind of someone trying to cope under extreme conditions while being utterly isolated, but was completely disappointed; I felt as though I was reading an algebra/chemistry textbook instead of a novel. Rather than giving rich detail into the mentality of the protagonist as he tries to figure out how to survive or delivering an interesting plot beyond the survival of one character with no significant background and with nothing at stake other than his life (which is hard to care about without any development at all of said character), the author instead delivers an astounding amount of unnecessary information pertaining to the characters methods of survival, filling each page with a myriad of numbers and formulas that do absolutely nothing to invoke emotional investment in the story. Though not poorly written, the material just simply failed to deliver anything engaging.</span>"
4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RNMLI8B4XWI4D?ASIN=1491590173	A really good book, and I'm picky	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">If you like a little sci-fi, especially the more realistic kind that isn't about little green men, this is really well worth a read. An imaginative story, a truly likable guy for the main character.  Plenty of suspense, but not superfluous suspense - it's all believable.  You'll have several smiles at the dialog/narrative, but it isn't that trying-to-be-funny-but-failing stuff you see so much.  My only complaint is that the publisher should have had another editing round to correct typos - it's annoying and often will put me off a book.  But not this one. A very good author, hope he does more (and gets a better publisher).</span>"

The author has outdone himself with the background research on Mars exploration. I read somewhere that he wrote programs specifically to calculate the orbits maneuvers, well it showed!

Half Apollo 13, half MacGyver, with a little Bear Grylls mixed in.  I appreciate that, aside from some minor friction between NASA officials, there are no villains in the plot. There was no need for this to be anything but an adventure story, and the only bad guys an adventure story needs are fate and nature.  Well done.</span>"

5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RK4XW65JRDIHX?ASIN=1491590173	You saw The Martian, you loved The Martian - should you still read the book?	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">About a year ago I made the conscious decision to read more science fiction. I’ve always read a lot of Star Trek and Star Wars tie-ins and other novels, and I’ll continue doing that. But I wanted to broaden my horizons to include some of the classics and current science fiction books. When it comes to the classics, I’ve been reading Asimov, Herbert, Card, Bradbury, and Clarke. They’re names I’ve known forever, but each has at least one masterpiece that I wanted to check out. For current science fiction, I’ve been reading The Long Earth series by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter, The Expanse series by James S. A. Corey, and “Red Rising” by Pierce Brown. Each has had a novel released in the series in 2014, with ""Red Rising"" starting a trilogy last spring.<br/><br/>“The Martian,” now a movie starring Matt Damon of course, was my favorite book of 2014. I loved pretty much every page. It’s a rarity in that it’s a science fiction book, but every part of it is believable. Weir has a background as a programmer, and his more technical approach to writing is evident. Sometimes that means a cold, nonhuman feel to a book—not so here.<br/><br/>The plot is this: Mars has been visited twice before by mankind—on the third trip, shortly after landing there’s a disaster. One crewmember is killed, the rest evacuate and begin their return trip to Earth. Only the crewmember they leave behind isn’t dead. He’s Mark Watley, and he becomes a sort of modern day (okay, near-future day) Robinson Crusoe. Watley is uniquely qualified to be stranded on another planet—he’s a botanist and engineer, skills he’ll need in order to survive.<br/><br/>Weir does a masterful job of helping us feel the loneliness Mark is going through. He lost all communications with Earth with the initial disaster and loss of the landing vehicle, and is more alone than any human has ever been. He finds ways to cope with it, but Weir lets us feel the despair the astronaut is going through. We also get to experience Mark’s claustrophobia. There was a habitation module on the surface at the landing site, so there’s a place to live, ways to generate oxygen, some water, etc. But he’s locked in that bubble for long stretches of time.  Weir’s descriptions of the hab are clear enough that we can picture it, and long for Watley to get out as much as he does.<br/><br/>The fun thing about any survival novel—“Hatchet,” “Swiss Family Robinson,” “Danny Dunn and the Deserted Island,” whatever—is seeing how the character manages to cope with disaster despite the odds. The other fun thing is wondering if you could survive yourself, and how you would do things differently. Mark Watley is a brilliant character, and he makes missteps along the way. The book is told mostly through his log entries, which make his survival questionable. No matter how brave or smart or funny he is, there’s not a way for him to get back to Earth. There’s not enough food to last the years it will take for NASA to come pick him up, and it’s not clear he has enough emotional reserves to make it either.<br/><br/>Some readers haven’t liked the too-technical parts of the book, and that’s understandable. Sometimes Weir’s explanations of airlocks and valves and gauges sound as detailed as Tolkien describing a frigging elvish doorknob...but it’s always to an end. His descriptions make Watley’s predicament more visceral, and our journey with him as thrilling and intense as possible. This is a book you won't want to put down, one you'll call in sick to read. It's one you laugh out loud at, gasp at, and even cry at. If you're a crier. It comes down to this: if you’re a fan of more realistic science fiction than fantasy, ""The Martian"" is an incredible read.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2JXP7WZQICKZ4?ASIN=1491590173	Sucked me in	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">In honor of the movie’s release day, I figure I should finally post my review of this book! My husband heard about THE MARTIAN from a coworker and asked me to order it for him a few months ago. I was a bit on the fence about it after reading the back cover, but when my husband proceeded to read it in one shot overnight (yay jetlag!) and started raving about it when I woke up the next morning, I figured I had to give it a try.<br/><br/>My main recommendation with this book is to give it a fair shot. I’d have ditched it after three chapters without my husband’s encouragement to keep reading because I’m not a fan of the diary structure in novels. However, that only lasts for 6 or so chapters before we start to learn how things are shaping up back on Earth. That’s when I really got sucked in! The switch from first person to omniscient point of view and back can be jarring at times, but overall the book flows well.<br/><br/>Mark Watney is a bit of a superman, but has a down-to-Earth (ha!) narrative tone in his diary entries, and I mostly buy his all-encompassing knowledge based on the fact that astronauts chosen to make such a trip probably would be that smart, especially with such a limited crew size. He still screws up and he’s still human in his reactions to his adventure, which does a good job of grounding the character.<br/><br/>I appreciate the amount of research the author had to do for such a novel, but he does a good job of avoiding the dreaded “all this research, let me show you it” info dumps. Instead, we are treated to narratives that serve as the main character working out scientific problems rather than as boring exposition.<br/><br/>This book does not need a sequel, but I would definitely be interested in seeing what the author comes out with next. I haven’t seen the movie yet (anxiously awaiting for Monday), but I’m encouraged by the good things I’ve heard so far.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3KV7DYRZ6TW2U?ASIN=1491590173	Robinson Crusoe on Mars	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I have just finished reading the most amazing book, The Martian by Andy Weir. Perhaps you have seen the advertisements for the forth-coming movie starring Matt Damon as the Martian of the title. The movie is not out yet, and it is unlikely that I will watch it before it comes out on DVD, but I did read the book to see what all the hype was about. I d not know how they will adapt this book to the movie, such adaptations are always a chancy business and I am rarely satisfied with the result, but if the movie is at all faithful to the plot of the book, it will be well worth watching.<br/><br/>The Martian is not, as the title would suggest, a science fiction novel about a person from the planet Mars. Instead it is the story of astronaut Mark Watney who is one of a crew of six astronauts on a mission to explore Mars. A dust storm causes NASA to abort the mission after only six days on the surface of Mars and Watney is seemingly killed while the crew is trying to get to the Mars Ascent Vehicle which is designed to return the crew to their orbiting space craft Hermes which will take them home to Earth. However, Watney is not dead but has been left behind, all alone on Mars with no way to return to Earth or even to communicate with NASA. The rest of the novel is concerned with Mark Watney's efforts to stay alive on Mars until he can be rescued.<br/><br/>In many ways, The Martian is a hearkening back to the great, old days of science fiction, to a more optimistic time when science fiction was about man's exploration of the universe and nothing seemed impossible with the application of scientific knowledge and reason, rather than the pessimistic post-apocalyptic dystopias and social justice warrior crap that one sees too much of in the genre these days. The plot is well paced and exciting. Although I knew that Watney will make it off of Mars, this isn't the sort of story that has him die at the last minute, the question of just how he will manage the next crisis kept me, almost literally, at the edge of my seat and made the book almost impossible to put down. Mark Watney himself is an engaging character, something of a twenty-first century Robinson Crusoe, clever and resourceful enough to find ways to survive. Just as Crusoe was able to salvage his wrecked ship to enable himself to survive on his island, Watney is capable of making use of the equipment left behind on Mars. Much of the story is told by way of the audio log he keeps and his often humorous commentary on the conditions and problems he faces helps to make what might be tedious exposition enjoyable to read. There is no Man Friday on Mars for Watney, but scavenging the Pathfider lander allows him to regain contact with Earth which surely must be just as momentous as Crusoe's finding a footprint in the sand and realizing that he no longer has to face his troubles alone.<br/><br/>The story is also told from the point of view of Mark Watney's crew-mates and the engineers and administrators at NASA who are desperately trying to find a way to bring Watney home, or at least send him supplies to last until the next mission to Mars. They are shown to be competent, loyal and determined and in that respect The Martian reminded me of the movie Apollo 13. The science in the Martian is rock solid and this is one of the hardest, on the scale between hard to soft, science fiction books I have ever read. Andy Weir is the son of a scientist and a student of science himself. All of the technology in the book is based on real life technology we have right now and the mission to Mars is based on real plans that NASA might adopt to send astronauts to Mars. Weir's portrayal of Martian conditions is based on the very latest information from probes. If a man ever did get stranded on Mars, this is a realistic story of how he might survive.<br/><br/>I can highly recommend The Martian to any reader whether science fiction fan or not. There is just one problem. The Martian actually makes the prospect of living on Mars seem desirable. Ever since I finished it, I have had the most intense desire to hop on a spaceship and go to Mars myself. Where do I sign up?</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3N7HMOATLXZ2J?ASIN=1491590173	Love This Book!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Imagine being one of the first astronauts to step foot on Mars. It's a cold, barren planet, but that's all fine since you and your crewmates will only be staying for about thirty days to conduct experiments. Except that there's a sudden storm and you all have to evacuate in a hurry, and during the frenzy of leaving, it looks like you've been fatally lost, so your crew leaves. Trouble is, you're still alive, you're all alone, and you have no way to communicate any of this. This is astronaut Mark Watney, and he's in deep trouble.<br/><br/>The Martian is gripping and intelligent from the first words (of which truer ones have rarely been written). I was impressed from the earliest pages by the ingenuity and resourcefulness Mark has; he not only figures out how to grow potatoes in order to prolong his food supply, he makes his way to an abandoned probe named Pathfinder in order to find a way to communicate with Earth. Once his predicament is known, NASA spends countless time and energy in developing a plan to rescue him. If it seems as though this would make for fairly boring reading, it doesn't. I was on the edge of my seat with each attempt, each failure, each idea, each page. If it's all very technical (impressive in and of itself), it all makes sense and just plain works. It's all believable.<br/><br/>The best part of The Martian, however, isn't the day-to-day survival story, or the spirit of cooperation inspired back on Earth, but the people themselves. Mark is absolutely one of my favorite characters ever, with his wit and wry comments that make you laugh out loud or plunge you into terror. He's the one you cheer for every second and feel for when there are setbacks. But he's not alone in being compelling by any means. The NASA people, including Venkat Kapoor, Mitch, Teddy, Annie...they are real and engaging and cheer worthy as well. The crew of the Hermes (the ones who accidentally left Mark behind) are funny and smart and determined; I seriously think none of them could have been written any better.<br/><br/>The Martian is one of those books I'm going to be cheerleading for for a very long time to come; it's definitely a cut above most of the reading I've done in the past year or so. If you think it's only for science fiction fans, think again; I absolutely challenge you to not become engrossed within the first fifty pages. Pick up and give it a try...you're going to love it.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1HX6FUB6OQ2HN?ASIN=1491590173	Intense and action packed sci-fi read great for even non sci-fi readers!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Just six Mars days (sols) after landing on the Red Planet, the Ares 3 mission is brought to a violent end. A massive storm causes the crew to immediately evacuate and abandon what was to be a month-long mission. Mark Watney is left behind, presumed dead.<br/><br/>And yet Watney miraculously survived. Well, maybe not miraculously. After being almost run through with an antenna, the combination of his suit and the Mars atmosphere turned out to be a blessing. But now Mark is stranded. On Mars. And everyone believes he's dead.<br/><br/>There's been a ton of buzz about The Martian and though I'm definitely late coming to it, I can wholeheartedly swear to the fact that it's earned every ounce of praise!<br/><br/>This is science fiction for the non science fiction reader. Oh, it's perfectly suitable for sci-fi fans, but for those of us who find the genre a bit overwhelming and/or intimidating this is the perfect book. It's very science based, but Weir - through Watney - takes the time to explain it in a way that makes sense and is easy to swallow. Amazingly this doesn't hang up the narration at all. It's incorporated quite smoothly into the story as a whole. Part of this, and definitely one of the things that makes the book stand out, is the way the book is written: much of The Martian is set up as being Mark Watney's log of his experiences on Mars - explaining everything for anyone who might come across his report at some later date.<br/><br/>Mark is a FUN character. I mean, really fun. Considering it's already been announced that Matt Damon will play him in the upcoming movie (due out next year and directed by Ridley Scott!), I did automatically picture the character as the actor. But I think it's totally suited.<br/><br/>The Martian has the pacing and action of a thriller - even though it's mainly driven by one man on an abandoned planet. It's highly entertaining and actually pretty funny at times. It really is just a great read overall and one that will appeal to a very wide range of readers - if they'll chance a sci-fi book. Serious, I recommended this book to a teen looking for a good read. He read it, loved it, and passed it onto his classmates. After I finished it, I passed it onto my husband who also loved it and we've both been talking it up ever since.</span>"
4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1TKG8DF8WP0DA?ASIN=1491590173	From someone who hates science fiction	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Oh, how I loved this book. What makes it even sweeter is that I really expected not to like it at all. Darn you, Andy Weir. Why did you have to go and challenge all of my usual objections to the science fiction genre by turning it completely on its head?<br/><br/>As a rule, I hate Science Fiction. It all seems to be some variation of the ""Earth facing imminent destruction from little understood alien forces, random human saves the day, falls in love, the end"" theme. Booooorrrring. It's just not my thing.<br/><br/>What's funny is that I like science. OK, I love science. But the science in Science Fiction doesn't seem like science at all. It's more like magic. And in my opinion, if there's going to be magic, there had better be dragons.<br/><br/>I picked this book up because it was on sale, and I had heard a lot of great things about it from friends. I'm not sure why it didn't sit moldering on my TBR pile for years, but a couple of days ago I randomly decided to start reading. I have basically been glued to my kindle ever since. I actually used Whispersync to switch back and forth between the kindle book and the Audiobook from Audible.  I often listen to audiobooks while cleaning, and yesterday I was so addicted to listening to this book, I literally cleaned every nook and cranny of my house. I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning listening, despite the fact that I had an important business meeting early this morning.<br/><br/>What makes The Martian different? Weir does a great job of making the reader care about the main character, Mark Watney, which causes lots of tension as events unfold. Despite the seriousness of the subject matter, this book is really, really funny. The protagonist is like Stephen Hawking crossed with MacGyver and David Wong.<br/><br/>The audiobook was narrated by R.C. Bray, who did such a good job that I think I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much just reading the e-book copy alone. This is easily one of the best books I have read this year (and maybe last year too), and I can't wait to read it again soon.  Not surprisingly, Weir just won the Goodreads Reader's Choice 2014 award for Science Fiction with this book.  Well deserved.</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2BUGNW7VB6HC1?ASIN=1491590173	A Story that Grips the Mind	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I opened The Martian on Monday mid-morning and by that evening I had read 302 pages.  I finished it the following morning.  So, though I put it down it was really ""unputdownable"".  I truly had not expected it to be that good.  How wonderful it is to be surprised and not feel jaded.<br/><br/>My summary opinion first and then some details.  10 out of 10 for story idea and the world it is set in.  10 out of 10 for the way the plot unfolds over time.  5 out of 10 for dialog - but I forgive that, this once.<br/><br/>It's really a re-telling of Robinson Crusoe.  There are a couple of differences - in Robinson the motives of those who abandon him are different, and there is no other being, no Man Friday, on the island.  But Robinson has the same struggles as the main character here, Mark Whatney.  He has to build a home and find a food supply.  Robinson uses his technology - ropes, fish hooks, salvage from the ship - and Mark the abandoned astronaut uses his technology.<br/><br/>So, what makes it work, what makes it so gripping for me?  Firstly ... the story unfolds and progresses naturally (realistically) without resorting to the two main devices of unskilled storytellers, namely, the intervention of random events to make ""exciting"" things happen, or stupid people doing obviously stupid things.  Either of these more than once make me give up on a book (and its author).<br/><br/>Secondly ... who knew that the recitation of science could play a part in generating excitement as astronaut Mark  has to solve problems, again and again, just to save his life.  This incorporation of physical causes and effects is made to work supremely well.<br/><br/>This is a story telling that gripped me from first to last (isn't it an interesting experience to be ""gripped"" by a story?).<br/><br/>So, what next for this new bestselling author, Andy Reid?  Here are a couple of cautions.  Firstly, The Martian is painted (supremely well) with a very small palette.  It is breezily painted.  Here in no particular order are a few ""big"" colors not used: existential angst; love between human beings, terror of death (it is breezily touched upon here without the slightest sense of terror); sense of Spirit amongst this wondrous Universe; evil; futility vs. inspiration; primal nature; ""reality"".  Reprise of a small palette could very well work.  But it might not - leading to one-hit-wonderdom.  However, secondly, the dialog of the characters back at NASA really is poor.  Why is dialog such a problem?  Why do new (and seasoned) authors use the same small set of ""bad"" language that is not really used in real life but only in second- and third-rate movies and shows?  And why do these characters all sound the same?  Hopefully next time there is more than cardboard talk-outs.<br/><br/>If you like an ""adventurous"" story this one will grip and thrill!</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2TLD4JASBBR7I?ASIN=1491590173	A Mars a day stops your work, rest and play	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Mark Watney* has a problem. Quite a big problem. He's stranded on the planet Mars (it's a long story) with a year's worth of supplies. No one on Earth knows he's alive and the planned return mission won't land for another five years. What's a guy to do? Well, most of his survival tactics seem to involve setting fire to his habitat...<br/><br/>Andy Weir self-published The Martian in 2012 and if there's any proof needed that self-published novels CAN be good, then this - emphatically - is it. The self-published ebook sold like hotcakes before it was picked up by a print publisher the following year and it's now in development as a big-name movie.<br/><br/>The story is good, solid, hard science fiction, a cross between any castaway story you care to name and any astronaut-in-peril story you care to name. There's a healthy dash of techno-thriller in the mix with plenty of MacGyveresque science to keep the nerds happy. To be honest, some of the technical descriptions left me standing but it's easy enough to step around these points and get on with the story.<br/><br/>The writing is strong, competent and easy to read. However, the delivery swaps between First Person (Watney's Mars Survival Journal) and Third (events back on earth. This jarred to begin with in more ways than one. In particular, Watney's personal account helps to build a strong and sympathetic character portrait, whereas the characters covered in the other sections seem to lack any real oomph, faceless bodies for the most part, whose only role is to move the plot forward. As the story moves forward this becomes less of a problem, but it never quite goes away and the book suffers for it.<br/><br/>But what the hell?! The plot is a real corker! While it's nothing new (stranded, struggle to survive, race against time), follows a very klinear and predictable course and the eventual outcome is hardly beyond doubt, Weir somehow manages to weave a classically unputdownable story that easily transcends the narrative problems and literary cliches. I loved it. It's been a long time since I've read deep into the night but, having started reading one evening in bed, I eventually had to force myself to go to bed at 2:30 the following morning and then squeeze in a couple more chapters before truddging - gritty-eyed - to work a few hours later**. Every other chapter seems to be a cliffhanger and the lead character is so engaging (and witty) that you're dragged (willingly) from page to page.<br/><br/>In spite of its flaws, this is an enjoyable and hugely impressive debut.<br/><br/>* ""Mark Watney"" is no name for an astronaut. ""Buzz"", ""Buck"" or ""Jim"" perhaps, but ""Mark Watney""? It makes the poor guy sound like the third-in-line heir to a failed brewing empire...<br/><br/>** Hence the review's title</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2DE7UZXZ48K5Z?ASIN=1491590173	If you only read one book this summer--this is the one!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">The Martian by Andy Weir<br/>In some ways, this is an old-school space-opera. The Martian by Andy Weir is one of the best science fiction stories to come out of the last 20 years.  A real adventure story from the get-go, this story of an astronaut inadvertently left behind is gripping from page one.<br/>:<br/>Mark Watney is hilarious. He is the sort of man who gets through life by finding something positive in every disaster, and mocking the hell out of everything that is negative. A horrendous storm destroys much of their base, and his team is forced to abort their mission.  During the emergency evacuation of the Ares 3 landing site, he is severely injured in an accident that appears to have killed him. His body is unretrievable, and unaware that he is still alive, he is left behind. His companions begin the long journey back to Earth, grief stricken at his sudden death.<br/><br/>At first he has no communications, so it is a long while before NASA realizes he is alive, and that is only because a low-level scientist, Mindy Park, who has been assigned to monitor images returned by the Mars satellites decides to look at the Ares 3 landing site and realizes that human activity is still occurring. there, which can only mean he is still alive. Mark Watney is an astronaut, so of course he is extremely resourceful. He does what he has to in order to survive his injuries, and then figures out exactly what he must do to stay alive until the next mission.<br/><br/>A botanist and mechanical genius, eventually, Mark does the math and concludes that not only will he have to survive for more than a year, he will have to travel across Mars to the next mission’s planned site, with no GPS. He figures out a way to do that, by growing potatoes, and turns his habitat into a farm. He survives many near disasters in his attempts to supply his basic needs, and figures out a way to communicate with Earth, despite the fact that the communications array was destroyed in the storm that “killed” him.<br/><br/>The events that take place at NASA, the people there, and the way they pull together to figure out a way to rescue him before he runs out of food and water are gripping. The in-fighting is realistic and true to the way we humans are in real life, and the lengths some people go to in order to get him home are also both realistic and heroic.<br/><br/>If you only read one book this summer, I highly recommend The Martian. Originally self-published in 2012, the Martian is now set to be a movie and in May 2014 it was reported that Ridley Scott was in negotiations to direct an adaptation that would star Matt Damon as Mark Watney.</span>"
4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RK01CDH2FYR4E?ASIN=1491590173	An Instant Classic	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Yes. I am giving this book 5 stars. It isn't that often that it happens, but this one deserves it.<br/><br/>DIALOGUE – 3.75 STARS<br/>MONOLGUE – 5.00 STARS<br/>First off, what the author lacks in writing dialogue which has more than one person involved he more than makes up with internal monologues and story progression. Which just happens to be the main part of telling a story to begin with.<br/><br/>Luckily there were not too many times where more than one person are speaking amongst themselves. But during those conversations I cringed after a while as one after another each line of spoken dialogue ended with ""He said"" ""She said"".<br/><br/>PREMISE – 4.5 STARS<br/>I don’t really have to go into detail to give anyone an idea of what the story is about; it is pretty self-explanatory just reading the quick synopsis on the back of the book or just by reading it online. So I will save anyone a bit of time on that. I rate the premise of the book with a 4.5. I’m not knocking it down because I’m being rude. It loses a half a star kinda by default. There is hardly an original idea out there and the stranded-to-die-alone concept has been done before. Sort of in the vein of Robinson Crusoe, however to look at his situation now it seems more of a cake walk than the odds stacked against Mark Watney.<br/><br/>Now to the glorification of this book. I felt very included in this story as if the main character, Mark Watney was leaving me personally his log entries. I also feel like I was very informed with the gadgets and equipment he was using. He went into great but not too lengthy detail explaining what this apparatus did or how it functioned.<br/><br/>SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD<br/>Another thing I enjoyed which is more of personal reason is that the semi-sarcastic tone of the protagonist reminds me of a character that I have been writing myself. The first person perspective really enables a writer to bring the audience closer to their character, and in Mark Watney’s case I was genuinely concerned for his well-being. Now I don’t want to say that I knew the outcome was going to be a pleasant one, but with the high reviews for the story it was kind of a telltale sign that he would eventually survive his time on Mars. Not too many people like it when the main guy dies.<br/><br/>OVERALL SCORE – 5.00 STARS<br/>I know the math doesn’t add up, but as I said before this book caused me to be heavily invested in the main character and I felt like I was part of Mission Control attempting to help him safely back to Earth. So I am willing to look past this book’s miniscule flaws. I am also hoping that the author didn’t just have a one hit wonder with this book, and that a future book although not necessarily with the same character, but perhaps  with the same point of view story telling. My only improvement would be that it is not needed to add the “he said” “she said” after every statement. There are many other ways to indicate who is speaking than to overuse those phrases.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3KJ79C3NJ1HHU?ASIN=1491590173	My book highlight of the month	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">One of the best books I’ve read this year. Not devoid of flaws, but you know how sometimes, you’ll love a book in spite of those? That was one such time for me.<br/><br/>What I definitely liked:<br/><br/>Mark Watney is basically MacGyver stranded on Mars, trying to survive with whatever remains the Ares 3 crew left behind when they had to abort the mission and leave in a hurry. (Maybe readers who didn’t like that show won’t like this comparison either, but hey, I was 15 the last time I watched it, and I used to love it, so in this review, it’s going to mean “good”.) Surviving out of sheer dumb luck, when everybody believed him utterly lost and, well, dead, Mark has to use every bit of knowledge to make lemonade with all the Martian lemons he’s being thrown at. And there are a lot, from defective materials to his own mistakes. Fortunately, he’s both an engineer and a botanist, which means he does have enough know-how to improvise (as well as try to grow stuff; here go the first Martian potatoes). Unfortunately, he’s not a chemist or whatever else, so he also has to do things through trial and error. And while his predicament is absolutely horrible, since anything can go wrong anytime, it’s also funny and awesome.<br/><br/>Throughout the story, Mark’s voice is highly entertaining. Here’s a man who was picked for his skills, but also for his optimism and sense of humour, in the hopes that he’d be the social glue among the crew—who had to live together in close quarters for the long trip to and fro, as well as on Mars itself. And I think his way of apprehending his many problems was just as much a life-saver as his knowledge, because even though he sometimes lost it, it never lasted for long, and he went back to work soon after. This may seem weird and unbelievable to some, but in a way, I could relate to his character, although not to a complete extent, of course. (I’m the kind of person who’ll scream and run in circles for two minutes, out of panic, then will suddenly calm down and say “OK, back to solving that problem now; and if I can do so while throwing in some bawdy joke, I’ll do.” I kid you not.) So, yes, somewhat unbelievable—and somehow, I just couldn’t care less. I rooted for that character. I wanted him to survive. Period.<br/><br/>Simply put, this book was inventive and fun. I’m still laughing, thinking back to some of Mark’s antics:<br/><br/>  ""He turned back to Venkat. “I wonder what he’s thinking right now.”<br/><br/>  LOG ENTRY: SOL 61<br/><br/>  How come Aquaman can control whales? They’re mammals! Makes no sense.""<br/><br/>I couldn’t possibly comment. I’ve been known for worse silly random thoughts than that.<br/><br/>  ""Also, please watch your language. Everything you type is being broadcast live all over the world.<br/>  [12:15] WATNEY: Look! A pair of boobs! -&gt; (.Y.)""<br/><br/>So totally the kind of crap I’d pull as well, just for the sake of light trolling.<br/><br/>  ""I chipped his sacred religious item into long splinters using a pair of pliers and a screwdriver. I figure if there’s a God, He won’t mind, considering the situation I’m in.<br/>  If ruining the only religious icon I have leaves me vulnerable to Martian vampires, I’ll have to risk it.""<br/><br/>That one, too, cracked me up.<br/><br/>Also, there was a lot of hope in this book, in that Mark wasn’t left to rot and die. People wanted him to survive. His crew wanted to believe that he could make it, that they could help—and they were a great bunch of girls and guys, ifyou like thespace cowboy type. Even other countries helped, even though there wasn’t that much in it for them. Too good to be true? Perhaps. But also beautiful, a beautiful lesson in how sometimes, humanity is still able to unite. Not to mention the bigger-than-life side of this novel: a coming back to older times, to a period when we thought Space was at the tip of our fingers. I’m a child of the eighties, and I still remember my own ideas back then. Colonies on the moon and Mars. Flying cars by year 2000. The space programs progressing to such an extent that we’d travel far, far away by the time I’d be an adult. “The Martian” brought me back to such thoughts: a man able to survive for so long with not the best means, wouldn’t his experience help further the next missions, allow people to believe that so much more could be done, that they could push boundaries a little further?<br/><br/>Potentially problematic:<br/><br/>The scientific explanations, which were to my liking, but may not be to other readers’. My own background in that regard isn’t very developed, so I can’t tell if everything was exact; at least, it seemed to me that things were very well-researched, and made sense (both to me as a neophyte, and when it comes to “science in general”). I enjoyed reading about how exactly Mark came to this or that solution. Like when he found a way to make water. Also hilarious, by the way:<br/><br/>  ""Nitrogen: 22 percent. Oxygen: 9 percent. Hydrogen: 64 percent.<br/>  I’ve been hiding here in the rover ever since.<br/>  It’s Hydrogenville in the Hab.""<br/><br/>There’s no deep psychological development here. Normally, this would be a problem for me, but not here. I can’t explain why. Mark’s humour? The way people banded to try and save him? As said above, I rooted for him. The author made him so likeable I just didn’t care about the rest.<br/><br/>The shift from 1st to 3rd person. It was a little unsettling. On the other hand, I don’t really hold it as a flaw, because I understand why it was done, and I couldn’t see any other way to achieve the same thing. Mark’s narrative just wouldn’t be the same in 3rd person; and if everything was in 1st person, then we’d have no means to see what was happening on Earth, nor what was set in motion to help Mark. This is why I’m not knocking down a star. Besides, at least in this book, I can clearly understand the reasoning behind it (other books I read used the same kind of switch, but with no apparent reason, so…).<br/><br/>As you can see, the last two paragraphs would logically be flaws. But, once again: I don’t care. This novel blew my mind, plain and simple.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2SWMUQNO1NZ44?ASIN=1491590173	Space Geeks and Geekettes Will Love This!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Start with the real-life drama of NASA's efforts to bring the crew of Apollo 13 home safely after a Service Module oxygen tank exploded en route to the moon. Stir in a dose of Martin Caidin's astronauts-trapped-in-earth-orbit story ""Marooned."" Season with a dollop of George Pal's classic 1953 film ""Destination Moon."" Finally, sprinkle on a soupçon of the hit 2013 movie ""Gravity."" Blend together well, let rise and you end up with Andy Weir's ""The Martian.""<br/><br/>I'm not saying ""The Martian"" copies from those earlier works. Its storyline is fresh and original. Rather, consider the fact that space missions are inextricably bound to obey the laws of physics, and, when something goes wrong, there are only a limited number of ways to solve the problem. This story of astronaut Mark Watney, trapped alone on Mars when the crew of an exploration mission leaves him behind for dead as they return to earth, is as tightly driven by the realities of physics as a real spaceflight would be. It hooked me on the first page and maintained my interest at a fever pitch through the end.<br/><br/>Some of the reviews here call ""The Martian"" boring. I can understand how a reader with little or no knowledge of spaceflight might think that. After all, there IS a lot of techno-speak, and the drama in the story comes from Watney's slow, calculated and methodical attempts to stay alive in the frigid, hostile, nearly airless Martian environment using only the equipment and resources that the expedition left behind. There is little character development. You'll find no personality clashes, shootouts, good-cop-bad-cop routines or other human conflicts. Nor, in fact, are there any ""Martians"" as we would commonly use the term. It's simply man against nature.<br/><br/>I won't reveal plot details here. I'll just say the story is logical and consistent, and does not, as far as I can tell without running the numbers myself, violate natural laws of biology, chemistry, physics, orbital mechanics, thermodynamics, et al. The twists and turns of the tale are feasible, and the solutions to the problems Watney faces require no fudging or correction coefficients. They're strictly rooted in the realities of the physical universe.<br/><br/>I loved ""The Martian"" from the first page to the last. A thought that occurred to me many times as I read it was, ""This would make a great movie!"" It may be a little too dry and technical for some readers, but if you're a spaceflight hardware nut, you'll enjoy it immensely. Pick up a copy of ""The Martian"" and fasten your harness for a thrilling ride into space.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R38FL0S3B6K4X4?ASIN=1491590173	The.Best.Engineer.Porn.Ever. (but still engineer porn)	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Near future - NASA sends the third manned expedition to Mars. It should last 31 days, but on the six day a storm requires astronauts to abort back to Earth. While getting to their return module, one of the astronauts gets blown away, wounded by a piece of antenna, and left on the planet because his comrades presume him dead and could not find him in the dust. After the storm settles he is left with no communications, alone on the planet. The next Mars expedition will land in 4 years, 3000 km away, but he has water and food only for 400 days...<br/>With a start like that this book could be a psychological drama about a man with no hope filled with self-reflection and despair. In fact it's a complete opposite. Take the famous Apollo 13 movie, strip away all the drama, and expand all the jury rigging engineer stuff into a 300+ pages novel, and you'll get ""The Martian"". The main hero - Mark Watney is a high-tech Robinson Crusoe, if Robinson was a swearing uber-optimistic and humorous engineer-geek. His journal, which takes half of the space in the book is almost totally filled with him explaining his ingenious ways to fix and make things that would keep him alive, flavored with lots of swearing and nerdy jokes. You'll totally like him, but you would not know him, as he never lets anything really personal in his journal (even the fact that he has parents in Chicago is told by another person). Other characters - people back at NASA, and the crew of the returning mission also tend to focus on the scientific stuff, making some of them a bit two-dimensional. But most probably you'll hardly notice this because the technical part is near perfect. This is science fiction with much more science than fiction(as almost all the details of the expedition and equipment are taken from real Mars expedition plans), and still you would probably not put it down, so easily it reads.  If technicalities are not your thing, if you want a deep, psychological, nuanced book, which will make Liberal Arts PhDs salivate - avoid at all costs. This is engineer porn: clear, exciting, inspiring and very, very plausible, and if you are into such sort of I can guarantee you an incredible nerdgasm.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1V6J89MY4QIM3?ASIN=1491590173	Math! Science! Potatoes!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This must have been a good book because I finished it in 48 hours, and I couldn’t put the book down once I hit the three-quarters mark. Any quibbles I may have with the book were made up for by it’s stress-inducing finale. Good stuff.<br/><br/>As the cover would seem to indicate, the novel is all about an astronaut, Watney, who is accidentally stranded on Mars. Then he spends the rest of his time using Science! and Math! (and Potatoes!) to survive. For the first half the narration is told mostly in journal form, but eventually other characters and other perspectives are brought to bear and Weir tells their stories in more traditional forms.<br/><br/>The story itself takes a little while to develop, and at times the book reads more like the world’s largest word problem from my freshman math class. I usually understood the basic problem Watney was solving, but after about the third “word problem,” I started glossing over the numbers to see if he had come to a solution or not - he usually does.<br/><br/>The mix of writing styles works for the most part, building suspense up to the very last page. The question is, will Science! and Math! get Watney to the end of the book? Or will he end up like Pathfinder, cold and lifeless? You’ll just have to read and find out.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the premise of the book, and I’m actually surprised that more authors have not written in the very-near-future-space-exploration-thriller niche. The only other book that comes immediately to mind is James Smyth’s The Explorer. (Though to be fair, they are very different books.)<br/><br/>While most adults will enjoy reading the book, I think that high school students would really enjoy reading the book, too. There’s lots of cussing in order to make the book edgy, but the characters often come with the sarcasm of a witty adolescent. This will be an easy book to hand to my high school students - they’ll quite like reading it, and they’ll feel smart doing so.<br/><br/>For a first book, this is a very strong debut for Mr. Weiss, and I sincerely hope that he continues to find success so that we will have many more of his books to read.<br/><br/>On a side note, the book cover, simple though it is, is absolutely beautiful. I spend a lot of time complaining about bad book covers, so let me say again that the cover for The Martian is stunning. The images on your computer don’t do the real-life version justice.<br/><br/>My Festivus Review and My Airing of Grievances:<br/><br/>Good Lord, no one in the position of Watney, stranded on Mars, would be so calm and collected, let alone cracking the ridiculous amounts of stupid jokes! The normal, serious demeanor of most astronauts in a crisis is no where to be found on Watney. I would be much more forgiving of his personality, if it had started serious and evolved into something more loose and natural, but from the very first page he is nothing but bad jokes. It is so hard to feel for a character who doesn’t go through a normal range of emotions. Being left on Mars should be a soul crushing ride of emotions, but we only get one emotion from Watney: smartass. And not even a very clever smartass at that. You can only type the word “Yay!” a few times before it gets old...and it got really old in this book. I actually felt more for the supporting characters because they went through real emotions. I didn’t get nervous that Watney would be rescued, I got nervous that the supporting cast wouldn’t rescue him. Books aren’t supposed to be that way! While this was a good book, fixing this one issue would have made the book fantastic.<br/><br/>However, I still really liked this book.<br/><br/>Alright. I guess that’s the end of my review. (Yay!)<br/><br/>(Facepalm.)</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3LWL47BCS4THA?ASIN=1491590173	"""Mars is there, waiting to be reached."" - Buzz Aldrin"	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">After an accident during a dust storm, Mark Watney finds himself alone on Mars. His colleagues in the Ares 3 expedition believed he was dead and were forced to evacuate the planet while they still could. The communications system was broken in the storm so Mark can't let anyone know he's alive. And it's four years till the next scheduled mission to Mars. Fortunately Mark has a few things going for him. He's an engineer and a botanist, there's quite a lot of equipment left over from the mission including the Hab - the living quarters complete with atmospheric and water reclamation equipment - and, perhaps most importantly, he has twelve potatoes. And most of all he has the determination to survive...<br/><br/>This is a fantastic adventure story set in the near future. It's not really sci-fi in that all the science and equipment is pretty much stuff that's available now - and though it's chock full of science and technology, it's presented in a way that makes it not just interesting but fun. Mark is a hero of the old school - he just decides to get on with things and doesn't waste time angsting or philosophising. And he's got a great sense of humour which keeps the whole thing deliciously light-hearted. It reminded me of the way old-time adventure stories were written - the Challenger books or the Quatermain stories mixed with a generous dash of HG Wells - but brought bang up to date in terms of language and setting. And although Mark is heroic, he's a believable hero - he's a NASA-trained astronaut with a scientific background, so it's easy to accept that he knows how to make stuff work and also to believe that he is psychologically and physically equipped to deal with this kind of extreme situation.<br/><br/>As the book progresses we also get to meet the people in mission control and Mark's erstwhile colleagues on the space-ship. Again, although they are shocked by what has happened, they show their professionalism by just focussing on finding a solution, reacting to each new development as it happens. So refreshing to not have to spend hours and hours reading about how they felt! There's a place for that in fiction obviously, but sometimes there's a place for a rollicking good roller-coaster of an adventure yarn too - and that's what this is.<br/><br/>When a book becomes a huge runaway bestseller, there's always the fear that it can't live up to the hype. Fear not! This one certainly does! It started out as a self-published book which sold in the zillions, has now gone on to be traditionally published, and the film rights have already been bought up. Well written, though not at all literary; great characterisation in the tradition of the heroes of Star Trek, Buchan et al; enough science and stuff to satisfy the geekiest geek but explained simply and humorously enough for us technophobes to understand - and a brilliantly depicted setting on the surface of Mars. All the best sci-fi comes from Mars and this is a new one to add to that illustrious list. Put it on your TBR!<br/><br/>NB This book was provided for review by the publisher, Random House Ebury.</span>"
4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R31N4UO9TWJ9CB?ASIN=1491590173	McGyver On Mars	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Mark Watney is having a bad day.  He’s part of the third manned mission to Mars, but while outside on an EVA, a large windstorm hits.  It’s so brisk that it tears the satellite dish off its mount, which impales Mark.  He’s last seen blowing away, and his suit telemetry confirms that he’s dead.  The rest of the crew has no chance to search for him, because the wind is getting ready to topple their ship, so they have to blast off immediately.  Thing is though, Mark isn’t really dead . . .<br/><br/>This book starts with a great and original idea, but in the world of sci-fi, that’s no guarantee of success.  Weir takes the idea, fleshes it out, breathes life into it, then lashes a rocket engine to the pace and lights the darn thing.  It’s fascinating, spellbinding, and nearly heart-stopping, while staying completely realistic and believable.  The challenges and roadblocks Weir invents are as diabolically evil as Watney’s solutions are ingenious.  He no sooner solves one life-threatening problem and something completely unexpected pops up.  But he’s far from perfect, as his own mistakes and oversights nearly kill him more than once.  Fortunately he has total confidence in himself, and a wickedly twisted sense of humour to keep himself company.  If you’re familiar with Stoker Ace (from the book “Stand On It”, not the movie), you’ll have some idea of what to expect.<br/><br/>There’s a lot of science in this sci-fi, but it’s not just for techno-geeks.  There’s a surprising amount of authentically handled human drama and emotion on display as well.  As news of Watney’s survival spreads, he becomes the media darling of the century.  Many authors would have let this spin out of control, but it’s tightly contained here and very deftly handled.<br/><br/>If watching someone overcome near-impossible adversity gives you a nice warm-fuzzy glow, you’re going to love this book.  It is simply superb on every level.  Very highly recommended.</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R5PJLHNXE5XSB?ASIN=1491590173	A modern classic	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">The Martian is written in a lively voice that I can easily imagine belonging to a frustrated engineer. It isn't an eloquent voice but it isn't meant to be. Mark Watney has a right to feel frustrated as he narrates his story, having been (understandably) left for dead on the surface of Mars by a crew escaping from a hellacious sandstorm. The base in which the crew planned to live is intact but the communications dish Watney needs to contact Earth is destroyed in the storm. Another crew is scheduled to land (although far from his current location) in four years. Watney has enough food to survive for about a year. Seems like the poor guy should starve to death if he doesn't choose a more peaceful death by morphine, but Watney turns out to be a resourceful scientist who doesn't easily give up on life.<br/><br/>New characters are eventually introduced as the action shifts to Earth and to NASA, which eventually notices that the Rover left behind on Mars seems to have moved. The parts of the story that take place on Earth are surprisingly strong in their own way, and a sharp contrast to the individualistic story that Watney tells. Like the rest of the novel, the Earthbound story seems realistic, from the distress that people feel about Watney to the distress they feel at managing a public relations nightmare.<br/><br/>On one level, The Martian is a survival story, sort of an updated <a class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robinson-Crusoe-on-Mars/dp/B00AALCT7G"">Robinson Crusoe on Mars</a> without the monkey. But it's also a pure science fiction story, with a refreshing emphasis on science. There are no zombies here. At the same time, explaining the science doesn't bog down the story, as science-heavy sf too often does. This is fundamentally a story about people and crisis management. Andy Weir put an enormous amount of thought into The Martian, from commemorative stamps honoring Watney that need to be recalled to overtime funding for NASA scientists who work desperately to save his life.<br/><br/>The Martian strikes me as a novel that should have broad appeal. Fans of geek-speak who think science and technical innovation are the most important aspects of sf will find loads to enjoy. Readers who think sf needs to have human interest to differentiate it from a technical manual will find it here in plentiful supply. Readers who only want to spend time with likable characters will love Watney (he's a funny guy). Even readers who like action-filled plots should be happy. The action doesn't consist of battles with aliens using laser swords but the struggle for survival creates a fair amount of tension and keeps the story moving at a good pace. Readers who crave zombies will be disappointed but I suspect most sf fans will be as happy with The Martian as I was.<br/><br/>The Martian ends with a discussion of human nature. Humans can be truly awful to each other, but most of us have an instinctive desire to help one another, even to help complete strangers when lives are at risk, and to risk our own lives to do it. Through Mark Watney, Weir reminds us of our better natures. According to Watney, people who care about other human beings ""massively outnumber"" people who don't. I think that's probably true. It's a great reminder, movingly illustrated in an emotionally enriching story. I suspect The Martian is destined to be regarded as a classic work of sf. That's pretty remarkable for a book that was originally self-published.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R19ZPJCIWOISXB?ASIN=1491590173	Mark is a great hero	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">The Martian by Andy Weir is a genuinely entertaining, humorous, engrossing hard science fiction thriller that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. It is very highly recommended.<br/><br/>When a dust storm causes the rest of his crew members to abandon their mission on Mars, Mark Watney is hurt by a flying antennae form the satellite system and presumed dead by his crew mates. By a set of freak circumstances he survives the injury and breach to his suit and now must figure out a way to survive on Mars until the next mission arrives. Mark has a limited amount of supplies and no communication with the outside world. What he does have is an amazing gift of ingenuity for finding solutions to impossible problem.<br/><br/>Mark came on the mission as a trained botanist and mechanical engineer. What you really need to know is what I thought while reading The Martian: This is MacGyver on Mars, or Robinson Crusoe on Mars, or a real survivalist on Mars. The story of his plans and how he figures out what to do next is written/recorded as journal entries and is fascinating and totally engrossing.<br/>I can't claim to understand all the science behind his fixes and figures, but I was pulling for Mark to continue to find solutions to all the problems that cropped up.<br/><br/>Most importantly to the story is the simple fact that Mark is a great hero. He approaches all the problems facing him with a sense of humor. While you are pondering the complicated steps he must undertake to survive, you will also be laughing and chuckling at his approach to life. For example: ""Remember those old math questions you had in algebra class? Where water is entering a container at a certain rate and leaving at a different rate and you need to figure out when it'll be empty? Well, that concept is critical to the 'Mark Watney doesn't die' project I'm working on. I need to create calories."" (Location 323) Or his comments over the 70's sitcoms one of his crewmates brought along for entertainment that he is watching: ""Anyway, much more important: I simply can't abide the replacement of Chrissy with Cindy. Three's Company may never be the same after this fiasco. Time will tell."" Location 481.<br/><br/>Eventually NASA figures out that Mark is still alive and living on Mars. There is a nice contrast between the tension filled NASA scenes and what should be even more tense scenes with Mark on Mars, but Mark is such a clever and witty Mr. Fix-it that you just know he will overcome all  the problems thrown at him until the bitter end. This is a great hard science fiction novel!<br/><br/>Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Crown Publishing via Edelweiss for review purposes.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R38PIP331IPRSN?ASIN=1491590173	Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">To phrase this the way the main character, Mark Watney, might say it:  ""Hell yeah this was a great story; a ****ing great story.""  I purchased the Audible audio book version - then the Kindle version afterwards just to have it.  $0.99 - Andy Weir!!  This was better than most novels I've read in a long time, 99 cents is a steal!!<br/><br/>I'm glad I was finally able to enjoy this story, and I am glad I did the audible version.  I am a huge fan of ""Realistic SciFi"" and this fits the bill!! I know many people got bogged down with all the ""math"" in this story, so listening to the Audible version helps, you can just half listen to some of that.  I don't know how many hours Andy Weir spent working out all these scenarios but it must have been a lot, but I'm sure he enjoyed it.  Then the narrator, R.C. Bray, WOW, he did a great job.  I bet he's got almost as many voices than Rich Little!  It really helps immerse you into the story.  Sure, the females sounded a bit like Alec Baldwin, but I liked that in a strange sort of way :)<br/><br/>I listened to most of this on a 1,200 mile trip to Florida.  Once we reached the point where it started to get warm, we discovered our AC wasn't working.  When the kids started to complain I wanted to tell them: ""After what Mark Watney had to endure on his trip to Schiaparelli I don't want to hear you bleeping whine about a little AC problem.""  Of course I didn't but I did turn on the 70's station and made them listen to disco the rest of the way!  You'll know why that's funny when you read or listen to the story.<br/><br/>Andy Weir has many great one liners; probably the best is ""Yes, of course duct tape works in a near-vacuum. Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped!""<br/><br/>Fair warning - you must be grown up enough to handle a fair amount of cuss words, and the F-bomb a lot, but the story is great, and the narration is awesome!!  The ending is classic!<br/><br/>By the way, if this were to be made into a movie, it would totally put ""Mission to Mars"" to shame! TOTALLY<br/><br/>Enjoy!</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R101LZ90G6LXSF?ASIN=1491590173	Amazing Hard SF Book	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This is a great story that kept me up all night reading it. It is basically the story of an astronaut who is accidentally stranded on Mars because the rest of the crew thinks he is dead and they were not able to recover his body before they had to evacuate. Rather than curling up into a fetal position and dying, he keeps using his head and ""working the problem"" in order to survive until he can be rescued. This story is set roughly twenty years from now. If you have any kind of science, engineering or military background, you will very likely love this story and the overall attitude behind it. If you don't know much about Mars, you will probably learn quite a bit about it from this book.<br/><br/>The main big error has to do with how forceful that high velocity winds would be in the low pressure atmosphere on Mars. I also think that the communications difficulties are a little exaggerated. Right now, we currently have several orbiters over Mars that are able to communicate via line of sight with our two active rovers on Mars. In the story, the stranded astronaut has two crew rovers that have low power radios that would probably be able to communicate with some of the Mars orbiters that they would have at the time.<br/><br/>Finally, several reviewers have complained about the frequent usage of the evil F-word by the characters in the book. Really, they need to get over it. That is simply how most people talk when they are under extreme stress, especially in the military. I am sure it is the same way at NASA/JPL in stressful situations. You don't hear too many people saying ""Gosh darn it"" when lives are at stake. But if you will be deeply offended by some realistic profanity, then perhaps you should not read this book.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R47RB0Z8ZXAKU?ASIN=1491590173	"Great ""hard"" science fiction"	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Bought the Kindle version of ""The Martian"" by Andy Weir on the recommendation of my son, and I absolutely loved it.  My science fiction tastes run mostly to the ""hard"" side - I tend to avoid fantasy and prefer themes that address science or technology in some novel new way.<br/><br/>This book grabs you from the very start during a near-future manned mission to Mars.  The mission commander makes the decision to scrub surface activities due to an approaching sandstorm, and in the trek from their surface habitat to the lander, one of the party is swept away into the storm by debris and wind. After a fast and futile search, the commander is forced to take off with the remaining crew before the lander is disabled by the storm.  Of course this sets up the main plot where the lost crewman did not actually die and later regains consciousness realizing that they are now stranded on Mars with the only hope of rescue four years into the future when the next Mars mission is scheduled to land.  With food for only a single year and very limited resources, what do you do?  Is there any possible way to survive?<br/><br/>Told with a fresh writing style and a nice touch of humor, you get the story from the point of view of the main (stranded) astronaut, the people at NASA, and the rest of the crew on their way back to earth.  How do you get rescued when everyone thinks you are dead?  The plot develops with excitement, nice doses of plausible science, humor, and tension.<br/><br/>The ending is letter perfect.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of real science fiction, do not miss this book.  I haven't had this much fun reading sci-fi since James Alan Gardner's ""Expendable"".</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1HYIGL1XLXVKT?ASIN=1491590173	Interesting, but feels flat despite its details.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Mark Watney is lucky enough to be among the first wave of astronauts the examine Mars.  It's a dream come true, one big step for all mankind and all of that, until something goes wrong.  Suddenly, Watney is left alone on the planet's surface, to cope with the extreme weather and environment, and the knowledge that help won't be coming for a very long time.<br/><br/>THE MARTIAN is interesting; it has a somewhat unique premise that instantly draws the reader in.  And, at first, Watney's narration seems organic and realistic.  But then things get...boring.  Yes, there are quite a few details; this is clearly a labor of love for author Andy Weir, and that alone may keep some readers turning the pages.  But what really struck me was how the narration sort of repeated itself, to the extent that it became a strange combination of unrealistic and mundane.  Perhaps that's the point, but if so, it's lost on me. By the time the third-person narration kicked in, I'd already tuned out.  THE MARTIAN could've benefited from a stronger prose stylist; perhaps someone more interested in the writing as opposed to the science.  But don't let that deter you if you're wanting a realistic ""science fiction"" novel (i.e., a fictional novel about science).  THE MARTIAN has a lot to offer; it's not for everyone, and you have to put up with some lackluster prose and a protagonist who slowly grows disinteresting, but it's there.</span>"

The month of September,  I read Gone Girl (again) You, The Bible (every month read 5 books of the bible), The Girl On The Train, Dark Places, and The Martian- being the last one. Well, I regret it being my last book. This is one amazing book. I started reading it Sunday morning and was done with it Sunday night.<br/><br/>The Martian, tells the story of an astronaut ,Mark Watney, that become LEFT BEHIND. No not the apocalyptic Left Behind, but he was left behind on Mars after his other crew had to get out of there because of a storm. This leave the readers with the question... HOW IN THE WORLD WOULD MARK COME BACK TO EARTH? HOW LONG WOULD HE LAST BEFORE HE DIES?<br/>CAUTION: Read At Your Own Risk<br/><br/>This book shows the good and bad side of  Humanity. One side, you see some that are considered for the welfare of Mark; however, then you see the powers at play. Those that only care for a dollar and how they can turn such an even into a money making plan. Also, I believe this book shows the problem of our media. As in real life CNN, took a highly entertaining story and used it for it's ratings numbers. In chapter 6, the readers learned that CNN creates a new show called ""The Mark Watney Show"" dedicated to Mark Watney (and you thought CNN flight 370 obsession was bad, wait until you read this book).<br/><br/>If you want to read a book that going to educate you on some important issues on real friendship, the power of not having fear, while getting you hooked, then read at your own risk.</span>"

Yet, it only took me two good evenings and a short third to read this book. The reason it was so quick of a read because it was so good. When I can enter into a story and feel what the character is feeling, laugh with the characters, cheer for them, hurt for them and be driven through the suspense of their crises then it's a well told story. The book itself is entering the theaters in November and I saw a trailer for it on Sunday night. The trailer was so good I figured this was ""next"" for me in the tournament. So a second ""space"" book.<br/><br/>The Martian is about a botanist who is part of a team of 6 on the third manned mission to Mars. After six days on Mars a storm hits the team, they have to abort the mission, and leave Mars. Unfortunately, the main character, Mark Watney, is left stranded on Mars. The book is mostly a first-person point of view story about what Mark does being stranded on Mars. I don't want to give this story away because it is too good but I laughed, I cheered, I cried, I felt with Mark Watney everything he went through.<br/><br/>If the tournament was done and over tonight I'd have an immediate and easy decision to make for the winner. The Martian was that good and that fun. One question the book danced around and at least philosophically caused me to ask is what is the value of saving a human life? Certainly a good question to ponder. Goodreads readers have given The Martian an average score of 4.35. I gave it five stars.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RF5TITG4X8KZP?ASIN=1491590173	Better than Clarke	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I was very pleased to come across the trailer for the soon to be released movie adaptation of this compelling novel. I read this book the first time shortly after it's release on the Kindle and fell in love with the characters and the style and tone of the novel. A self-professed space geek, Andy Weir has created a puzzle that Astronaut Mark Watney must solve to survive. The technical details are rich, but never at the expense of the story and Mark Watney is wonderful character who's spirit shines trough from page one to page last.<br/><br/>I was not surprised to learn that Andy Weir grew up reading the same holy trinity of science-fiction (Asimove, Clarke, and Heinlein) that I did. This novel is the kind of science-fiction that I love to read and the kind of science-fiction that I aspire to write. After I read The Martian again (within hours of watching the trailer a dozen or so times) I turned my attention to another of my favorite novels - A Fall of Moondust by Arthur C. Clarke. The similarities are obvious - ""ship-wreck on the moon"" vs. ""castaway on Mars"". In both cases the principle characters struggle to survive and the outside world rallies to come to their rescue.<br/><br/>With a little more ""willing suspension of disbelief"" (more for the shift in social norms and the science) Clarke's novel holds up very well but I believe that Andy Weir has written the better book. I cannot recommend the Martain highly enough - ten stars if they'd let me.<br/><br/>Vern McGeorge<br/>author of All Fall Down</span>"

Every few pages sounds like a math problem you got in school.<br/><br/>Example: ""Let's call the volume of the airlock two cubic meters. The inflated EVA suit probably takes up half of it. So it took five minutes to add 0.2 atmospheres to 1 cubic meter. That's 285 grams of air (trust me on the math). The air in the tanks is around 1 gram per cubic centimeter, meaning I just lost 285 milliliters."" (p. 164)<br/><br/>This one negative is extremely important to consider if you're not a geek. These details are such an integral part of the story that you'll find yourself skipping lots of pages because of all the techie details that you'll classify as TMI (too much info).<br/><br/>The problem is that you won't get a sense of how geeky this novel is by just reading the sample, since the beginning of the book is not that nerdy. It gets technical as the hero has to solve all his problems.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: I love hard sci fi, so this book is perfect for me. However, if you're not into such realistic details, then skip this book.</span>"
2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RC4HCTK1WPHQU?ASIN=1491590173	Light hard sci-fi, fun read, definitely recommend!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This was the first book in months that made me stay up until 4 am to finish it. The story is great and the dialogue is very humorous.<br/><br/>First, some criticisms: it definitely could have used some editing in how parts of the story were organized--there's more than one Chekhov's Gun or plot device that comes out of nowhere which probably could have been avoided. However, that doesn't detract from a gripping story. At times, the dialogue comes across as not being realistic for astronauts chosen to be part of a Mars mission--but then, without some color, the story would have been much more bland. Most of the story is from a narrative, but in instances where there is some substantial conversation, Weir sometimes is too wordy and trips over himself. Of course, at this point, I'm kind of picking at things to critique--this was a GREAT story.<br/><br/>This definitely has some hard sci-fi elements, but it's written in an accessible manner that many can appreciate. Think of this as somewhere between MacGyver and Apollo 13, with better story and dialogue than the former, and more science and math background than the latter. Add a dash of Mars and put the story in the near-future, and you have ""The Martian"" by Andy Weir.<br/><br/>Be forewarned--there's a substantial amount of language in this book, if such things offend you. However, I'm recommending this book to everyone I know. You won't be disappointed.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R325JBSJNKKOWV?ASIN=1491590173	The Ultimate Survival Story	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I think I have read just about every novel on Mars exploration that has been written since the early 80's, and this one stands tall among the best of them. The near future tale of one astronaut's struggle for survival and rescue on Mars after being unintentionally left behind when the mission is suddenly aborted, Weir's protagonist provides an example of the boundless and seemingly impossible things humans can accomplish with knowledge and reason as their primary weapons.<br/><br/>The science gets a little wordy at times, but it is always well tempered and balanced by the protagonist's sense of humor and unsinkable personality. Also, whenever something of a complex scientific nature has to be explained, the author is always quick to throw in analogous references in layman's terms so people like you (I'm assuming) and I (for sure) can follow along.<br/><br/>Once the scene switched from Mars back to Earth after a few chapters and then started bouncing back and forth as the discovery and rescue attempt got underway, it was impossible for me to put down. Great characters, dialogue, and story twists abound as humanity tries to unite for the sake of saving one man marooned in the harshest imaginable circumstances. I highly recommend this book to any and all fans of science, science fiction, space exploration...or even just folks who like a great survival story, as this one is the ultimate!</span>"

4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1M0Z1TJUW4AAV?ASIN=1491590173	The most fun I've had reading a book in a long time!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Wow! An excellent investment of 99 cents. I read this book on a whim and am I ever glad that I did. I have seen some reviewers who have complained about some of the language in this narrative, along with others who complained about excessive technical details,blah, blah, blah. All I can say is that this story just wouldn't have been near as much fun without both.<br/><br/>I don't want to have any spoilers in this review, so I will simply say that I was drawn in from the very first sentence (and OMG it had profanity in it, which I'm pretty sure I would have used in a similar circumstance). The protagonist in this little epic was absolutely awesome in his never give up attitude no matter what went wrong in his efforts to survive until rescue could be undertaken and his irreverent take on things both good and bad just made this book that much harder to put down (ya gotta love a guy who can find humor when things go so wrong as to seem totally insurmountable).<br/><br/>Kudos to author, Andy Weir. This book should be selling for far more than 99 cents. Some reviewers have said that this book would make a great movie and I wholeheartedly agree, I just wish I had connection to get in on producing it!<br/><br/>I said I wanted to avoid spoilers but dang it I just can't help it...look boobs (.Y.)  Buy the book, you'll understand, haha!</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3LU66GRRQIRZ?ASIN=1491590173	One of the most gripping books I've read of any genre.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This book showed in my Amazon recommendations yesterday morning. Due to time constraints I couldn't finish it yesterday, something that I wanted very much to do. It's one of those books you just cannot put down. It is some very serious science fiction, placed in a near future and based on tecnology that if not readily available might just be around the corver.<br/><br/>It's a Robinson Crusoe kind of plot that centers around an astronaut left for dead on the surface of Mars. An enthralling tale of ingenuity and resourcefulness that ultimately come to a truly exploding grand finale.<br/><br/>At the going price (free, save for the US$0.99 that Amazon charges for its distribution) it is a true steal!<br/><br/>I've purchased a handful of other startup authors at very low prices and more than half of it have proved to be a waste of some change and time. Many of them can't write worth a dime. Believe me, this is not the case. After reading half the sample -an ample one, by the way- I spent my dollar to Amazon and downloaded it to my devices. I'm giving it to friends but not as a freebie as the author generously allows. Although the dollar won't go to his pockets but to Amazon, I hope the popularity does him some good. I would gladly pay a regular price for it. It's simply excellent; five stars plus a cherry on top!</span>"
4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3C2WT5MNR9VB7?ASIN=1491590173	...the ultimate page-turner !	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Stories of castaways stranded on a “far away” desert isle are<br/>not new, but stranded on Mars has to be the ultimate castaway tale.<br/>Through a series of accidents/circumstances Mark Watney is<br/>presumed dead by the other 5 members of his astronaut team and<br/>left behind on Mars.  His predicament(s) is a great example of<br/> “Murphy’s” law and was intriguing/ingenious how he faced and<br/>solved each crisis.  Not only has Andy Weir created a compelling story,<br/>but a well-developed and interesting character.  Mark accepts everything<br/>with an “it is what it is” attitude.  He never gives up and faces the<br/>overwhelming odds of his own death with sarcasm and snarky<br/>comments making his journal entries a delight to read.<br/>He is a survivor and one smart guy.  His ingenuity to solve each crisis<br/>had me wondering if this story isn’t more  “science” than “fiction” and found<br/>myself believing that surviving on Mars really is plausible.<br/>I felt like I was reading a real journal; I was rooting for Mark<br/>from page one.<br/><br/>This is edge of your seat story telling and the ultimate page-turner.<br/>Does he survive?  You’ll have to read his journal.<br/><br/>Not surprising, most of the reviews are 5 stars and I’m<br/>adding mine to that list.</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R32L6BVIYPUTJX?ASIN=1491590173	6 stars, or more.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I have read over 250 books since I acquired my first Kindle.  This is the first book I have gone out of my way to recommend.<br/>-Friend:  ""Hey Bill, what's new?""<br/>-Me:  ""Dude!  You have totally got to read this book.  Here, take one of my spare Kindles.  Give it 2 chapters.""<br/>-2 days later, Friend:  ""I call it my lucky rope.""  Hilarity ensues and those co-workers who haven't read the book eye us suspiciously.  Those who have read it join us in laughter.<br/><br/>Why is it so much fun?  Why do I think it is a great book?  There is a basic recipe in this book: a) state the situation, b) list possible solutions, c) list how each solution can go terribly wrong and end in death, d) state the solution and detail the method used, and e) list the unexpected and life-threatening consequences from the so-called solution.  Repeat.  Add liberal amounts sarcasm and engineering humor with a high degree technically accuracy. Result: Awesome and entertaining story.<br/><br/>While we were together as a family during Christmas, I got my Dad and both of my boys to read the book.  Rolling their eyes, they agreed to try it.  10 minutes later, laughter was heard throughout the house.<br/><br/>I especially recommended this book for anyone with a technical background.</span>"

"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">From the beginning I was impressed with the authors obvious knowledge of the workings within the space/government complex.  I worked for 21+ years in the intelligence arena and I can tell that the author has either first-hand knowledge or has done some very good research. I like the humor and the inside jokes between mission control and The Martian!  There are some typos and misplaced wording, but considering the price, it's a great read.  I've been reading SF for over fifty years and I have missed true Science Fiction; THIS IS SCIENCE FICTION!!</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2BTEXVCB7OK7P?ASIN=1491590173	Wow..... just....Wow!!!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This is the first review I've been truly compelled to write. If you don't mind reading a book that challenges you to think a bit this one is for you. Andy Weir has done the impossible, he's written a very technical book in a truly fun, exciting, and entertaining manner. He's made engineering, chemistry, and even botany very cool.<br/>My father is a retired NASA guy and I've made a lot of engineer jokes at his expense over the years but this book made me appreciate and understand him a little better. Thanks for that Andy.<br/>Weir has left no stone unturned in this exciting book. I was rooting for Mark the whole way. It was a nail biter and every time I was forced to put it down I couldn't wait to get back to it.<br/>Please don't let the fact I said its a ""technical"" book dissuade you from reading it! This is the best survival book I've read since Krakauers "" Into Thin Air"", and that is a huge compliment.<br/>I can't wait to see what Andy Weir does next. This book was a huge accomplishment by an amazing writer. I was never taken ""out of the moment"" not once during this book. Everything was executed so well from the dialog to the comedy to the suspense. Amazing book.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R73ZQK8TYBSJU?ASIN=1491590173	Wow. Best Sci-Fi Debut since Old Mans War.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I have been a science fiction fan since the late fifties. The problem nowadays is that everything is just the same old thing. That is why when I run across something that is new and well written, I have to comment on it.<br/>  The Martian by Andy Weir is just such a book. It is an extreme ""Survivorman"" story set on Mars. It is as if the writers of ""The Big Bang Theory"" wrote ""Robinson Crusoe"". It is heavy on the nerdy science part of science fiction but despite that it is impossible to put down.<br/>  Mark Watley, botanist and general handyman on a mission to Mars, is, through no fault of his own, stranded alone on Mars. He must figure out how to survive for more than 500 days until his first possible hope of rescue. He does some things that are incredibly brilliant and some that are just plain stupid.<br/>  The majority of the book is his log entries which are funny, sarcastic, fatalistic and, since he is basically talking to himself, have a ring of truth to them.<br/>  I remember feeling the same way about ""Old Man's War"" when it came out. I hope Andy Weir writes more books as I will be first in line.<br/>  Get this book, read this book. You won't be sorry.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1V4LDIYEDKYUV?ASIN=1491590173	An Inspiration	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">If I could give this book ten stars I would.  This book was not what I expected but once I started reading I could not put it down.  I read late into the night never quite knowing how the story was going to end.  It was irreverant at both ends which was thoroughly appropriate to the main character.  This is one of the best fiction/science fiction books I have read in a long time.  It was inspiring.  If I was still teaching this would become required reading so that students would hopefully gain insight into how important all those boring subjects - math, biology, chemistry, physics, psychology, engineering, mechanics, astro physics, botany, and many more - are to survival, how they interlink and interact with one another, and how learning is critical to survival.  One man stranded on Mars with only his humor, training, education, intuition, inventiveness, a little luck, bravery and a will to survive and his colleagues, on earth and in  space, who are also using everything the have to also help him survive.  I closed the book with a sigh of contentment and know I will do the same when I read it again even though I know the ending.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1HJPT2PJWX7A2?ASIN=1491590173	Hardest of Hard SF	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This is hard science fiction in its purest form.  An astronaut has been left behind on Mars  when the members of his expedition think he is dead.  Now he has to figure out how to survive and communicate with Earth. Finally he has to cross thousands of klicks of open Martian surface to a spot where he might possibly be rescued.  Meanwhile officials on Earth agonize over how to help  the castaway.  Based on current knowledge of Martian conditions and only slightly futuristic gear the story proceeds briskly through ingenious solutions and inevitable disasters.  Most of these are hardware/ engineering solutions sometimes described in technical detail.  There are no Martians, nobody invents faster than light travel, no miracles occur.  Readers expecting zip-bang action with ray guns and beautiful Martian princesses will be seriously disappointed. These people might try SM Stirling's ""Halls of the Crimson Kings"" a very enjoyable old-fashioned Mars story with all of the foregoing.  People that are interested in what Mars is really like and how things might actually work will enjoy ""The Martian"" thoroughly.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2TH2IG2CYPHGD?ASIN=1491590173	"""I never want to make the reader do anything but go 'cool' and that's it."""	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Andy Weir has stated that, when he writes, he doesn't have a point or moral to make.  The only reason he writes is to entertain.  ""I never want to make the reader do anything but go 'cool' and that's it.""  (Aug. 17, 2015 interview at L.A. Google office)  I suspect his stated intent explains the difference in mentality between those who love and those who hate the book.<br/><br/>I have a background in physics and work in aerospace/defense as an analyst, so qualify as a nerd who appreciates the technical details.  But the thought I had over and over while trying to slog through the book is why try to stretch what seems to be a ""how-to manual"" into novel form at all??  There is no larger emotional arc.  No thought-provoking big ideas.  No real backstory for the main character.  I really enjoy my nerdy friends and coworkers, yet find Mark Watney boring, obvious, and annoying.  The sardonic humor is unrelenting.  And the writing is regularly cliche and corny.  Ex. ""You wouldn't guess this botanist/mechanical engineer was a bit of a nerd in high school but indeed I was.""  (har, har)  Or this gem: ""It's hydrogenville in the hab.""  (Think my eyes rolled back into my head at this point.  Someone get me some oxygen! haha)<br/><br/>Mark Watney more closely resembles the office dweeb engineer than an esteemed botanist/mech eng/astronaut.  At least he talks like the former.<br/><br/>I love the idea for the story!  And I enjoyed watching Andy Weir talk about the book during the Google interview.  Clearly the author put a lot of effort into researching the science.  But, although I wanted to like the book, I just can't recommend it.  Am interested in watching the author develop as a writer and hope to enjoy future works.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1NX4M6C339MDM?ASIN=1491590173	"""Life is amazingly tenancious"""	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Life is also amazingly ingenious! And if Andy Weir's utterly enthralling debut novel, The Martian (out today!) is to be believed, life is also pretty freakin' funny when it's pushed to the brink.<br/><br/>Exhibit A is our hero here: Wise-cracking astronaut Mark Watney. Watney, as he tells us in the opening line of the novel, is pretty much f-----. He was a member a six-person manned mission to Mars. On the 6th day, a storm forced an evacuation, but Watney was clobbered with a piece of communications equipment, and his crew, thinking he was a goner, left him.<br/><br/>Now, Watney must figure out how to survive. Using his training as a botanist and a mechanical engineer, Watney makes water from leftover fuel, grows potatoes, and amazingly, is able to re-establish communications with NASA. But as you'd expect, obstacles continue to present themselves, and Watney must continue thinking quickly to solve them with the meager supplies and equipment he has on hand.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic novel for several reasons. Yes, the man against nature survival aspect is great — you'll think of this as Castaway On Mars. But also the science and problem-solving Watney displays — and this isn't survival for dummies — is really fascinating for anyone with an inclination toward science. Weir gets pretty technical on everything from chemical reactions to rocket design and engineering to hacking computers systems. I don't claim to understand everything, or even close to everything, but Weir definitely seems to know what he's talking about. You trust him. And it's all very fascinating.<br/><br/>But the best part of this book is the character Watney himself — he's right out of central casting for the nerdy science dude whose only defense against the world is sharp-witted, often juvenile, humor. Naturally, I loved it. Try this exchange on for size, between NASA who, at kind of a tense moment, is telling him how to modify one of the rovers to connect to the other:<br/><br/>  NASA: What we can see of your planned cut looks good. We're assuming the other side is identical. You're cleared to start drilling.<br/>  Watney: That's what she said.<br/><br/>Honestly, that's probably a bad example for how funny this novel really is (but, that one, because it was unexpected, hit me pretty hard right in the funny). Watney's often a bit more clever than this. But if Weir's goal is to get you to like Watney in order to root for him as hard you do, then mission accomplished. Over the course of the last hundred pages or so, things move so quickly, you have to remind yourself to breathe. Will Watney be saved?<br/><br/>It's a novel you're thinking about constantly when you're not reading, wondering what new problem Watney will have to overcome next (will he get to eat the ration he's saved for when he ""Survived Something That Should Have Killed Me""?). I loved this book, and think most other readers will too.</span>"
1.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1144P1FY0HFAZ?ASIN=1491590173	A promising story lost between the lines of a technical manual.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I wanted to like this book as there is the potential of a good story here, however the author sacrifices the story to cumbersome and excessive details that are as much fun to read as assembly instructions for a child's playground set; every nut and bolt gets documented over and over. But unlike the playground set, the story would hold up far better with fewer nuts and bolts. Yes, the author did his research thoroughly, unfortunately he let the research take over and bog down the story line. As a result, the characters suffer from lack of development. Mark Watney is the same guy from the first page to the last, his ordeal doesn't change him, we never see him sweat emotionally.<br/><br/>The NASA crew back home and aboard the Hermes are stock characters whose relationship to Watney is allowed to stagnate. There are areas throughout that beg for development, such as the world's collective response to one of the greatest rescue missions in history and Watney's relationship to his family at home. None of which ever gets off the ground and reads like just another day at the office. The overall tone is flat and is a disservice to the reader and story.<br/><br/>This should be an epic story that speaks to how an individual's struggle to survive can represent mankind's humanity, instead it concerns itself more with how to turn oxygen into rocket fuel, leaving the reader wondering who the real Mark Watney is other than a resourceful botanist stuck alone on Mars. I expect Matt Damon's treatment of the script will remove much of the author's overburdened technical narrative and restore the human element that is missing from the story. This is one novel where I'd prefer the movie doesn't stay completely true to the book.</span>"
4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2VIMKE11VV4BC?ASIN=1491590173	Very entertaining read.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I read this book months ago while it was still a work in progress available for free on the author's website.<br/>The author really did a great research job for creating the main character (who is a mechanical engineer/botanist/astronaut with a great sense of humor). The science of everything he does and the environment he lives in and his efforts to survive on the surface of a dead planet is very well presented and explained.<br/>Since the story takes place in the not-so-distant future, it intertwines very nicely with many aspects of our actual space program and the knowledge of our neighbor planet we have at the moment.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it to everyone who has even the slightest interest of mankind's current and future real-world endeavors in space. It is more akin to reading Sagan's speculations for the future of humans in space than Star Wars/Mass Effect space-opera type of sci-fi. So if you're expecting starship laserbeam dogfights against evil aliens from another dimension (which I'd be totally down for), you might want to look elsewhere.</span>"

I'm not stupid, but I'm not a scientist either.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>One thing that I really enjoyed about this book - it is hilarious.  I highlighted so many quotes.<br/><br/>When I was first reading it I was wondering how the heck they'd be able to keep things going for 400ish pages with just Mark's logs.  Then it switched POV, and I realized I would be getting a broader perspective of everything that was going on.  I was quite impressed by it.  This was, hands down, my favorite book that Sofia has forced upon me under the guise of her bookclub.<br/><br/>I'm not really a fan of movies in general, but I will have to go see this one when it comes out in theaters.  Everyone needs to read this book immediately!  I've been recommending it to pretty much everyone.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1HDTYKIQOECYO?ASIN=1491590173	Listen to this book!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This is a GREAT book to listen to. Most of it is the journal of an astronaut stranded on Mars after an accident causes the rest of his crew, who think he has died, to abandon him. Basically it is the story of a VERY resourceful guy coming up with extremely ingenious mechanisms to preserve himself in the hope that someone will realize he is still alive and come to his rescue. The technical details will fascinate nerds but would have come across as a bit excessive to me, since my tolerance for such details has definite  limits, if they had not been leavened by the protagonist's rather engaging personality. This is where the audio version shines; the narrator does an excellent job of portraying Mark's emotions as he experiences the triumph of a successful repair or the gloom as another problem arises.<br/>My husband and I both thought the ending was just a little abrupt; there were a few minor loose ends we would have liked to see tied up (MINOR SPOILER: Like what happened to some of the cameo characters we came to know in the Hermes crew and NASA).</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2VY7D1BKR8Z0E?ASIN=1491590173	My Favorite Martian	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">How can I possibly add anything worthwhile about a book that has been reviewed over 1700 times?  Although loaded with scientific jargon it boils down to a planet held spellbound over the fate of a botanist/mechanical engineer left on Mars after mistakenly assumed dead during an emergency evacuation.  Even the Chinese government chipped in to help with the rescue!  The book could have been dryer than the Martian surface but it is loaded with suspense, plot twists, drama and even some comic relief thanks to the wry observations of our deserted hero.  The story was so successful because it connected us on the human level with fleshed out characters from all aspects of space travel whether the highest level of NASA to a lowly technician.  If I ever blasted off into outer space(not going to happen) I would want these people behind me and guiding my journey. The true glue that held the storyline together was the solitude human being on Mars, Mark the geeky astronaut who quickly had every reader rooting for him.<br/><br/>Enjoy the read!</span>"
4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R31FBMZ2PCQRFN?ASIN=1491590173	good, humorous, thrilling hard scifi	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This is a well-written ""hard science fiction"" story with a moderate amount of ""sciencey"" exposition [all of which I enjoyed], a lot of sarcastic, witty humor, a very amusing and interesting central character, and a very real sense of thrill and anticipation as the plight of the main character develops.<br/><br/>There are a slightly greater than average number of uncaught, scarcely noticeable typographical errors, but for a super-cheap (and intended to be free) ebook without a large publisher backing it, this ebook is in fine editorial shape. The ebook also could benefit from having page numbers, but this is another minor, almost unnoticeable flaw.<br/><br/>This story, while a tad on the short side and not overly ambitious in its storytelling, is packed with action and detail without unnecessary ""fluff"", and I found it a pleasure to read. I personally feel that it stands on its own just fine among the works of better-known authors like Greg Bear, Stephen Baxter, and others whose work I enjoyed equally as much.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RE673KCNUBD4I?ASIN=1491590173	Excellent Hard-core Science Fiction	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">The Martian is a thoroughly enjoyable book, well written and meat and potatoes for a hard-science fiction fan. There's a lot of good humor and amusing moments that add spice to the work.<br/>The story of human survival against an environment hostile to life is classic. The hero, Mark, uses the most powerful tools at his disposal, his brain, science and a will to live. The science is well done. The author did his homework on this one.<br/>The characters are fleshed out without much in the way of description of their physical appearance. Hard to accomplish, but it works and works well.<br/>The race to save himself from starvation and his numerous trials as an astronaut marooned on Mars gives this novel a fast-paced pitch. It's the same with the folks stuck on earth who are trying desperately to rescue him. You're rooting for him and his rescuers all the way.<br/>In short The Martian is great read and I recommend it to any lover of good science fiction.<br/>Doug Welch, author of Shadow Spies.</span>"

It was intelligently written using both first person narrative and third person story.  The drama was created by creative, realistic and challenging ideas.  Not the usual third-grade mentality that most TV, movies or books try and shove down our throats.  The Protagonist *intelligently* solves the problems and expresses them in a real-world mentality.  I could so easily see myself in the same position, doing the same things, with the same warped sense of humor.  I'm not a NASA scientist, but the problem solving, number crunching and math, as well as the various devices used and the science behind them was refreshing to read about.  It gives would could be a very real reality of life on Mars.  Not a fictional, half-baked idea that lets the reader use their imagination and 'just go with it' for the sake of the story.  The Story itself was the intelligent problem solving to overcome actual challenges.<br/><br/>Pirate Ninjas as a unit of energy.... loved that part.</span>"
2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3H3L8TFJHACAJ?ASIN=1491590173	Riveting tale of survival	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This story deserves to win awards and be widely published and read. Follow astronaut Mark Watney as he is stranded on Mars and endeavours to survive. Written with lots of humour and tension ... and great characters.<br/><br/>It is now in my Top 5 all-time list of science fiction books, and easily the most engrossing novel of any kind I've read in ages. I couldn't put it down, a true page turner. I hope Andy Weir is encouraged by the growing feedback to write more hard science fiction, his prose explains a lot of hard stuff simply enough for a layman to follow and keep pace. I also hope the story is adapted for a movie or TV series ... perhaps Elon Musk of SpaceX could be the producer.<br/><br/>EDIT: (a few years later.) In 2014 the story is now widely published, Andy Weir is writing fulltime and Ridley Scott is directing Matt Damon as Watney due for release in November 2015. An Oscar-winning performance from Damon will do more for NASA Human Space Flight than anything since Apollo.</span>"

In fact I've never read an SF book more true to the science. The author is a self-described ""orbital mechanics dork"" who wrote his own software to make sure the movements of all the planets and spacecraft in this book were accurate.<br/><br/>But I'm not a big fan of hard SF. I admit to kind of zoning out through the scientific descriptions. Then why did I love this book? Because the story is incredibly compelling. You can't wait to find out what happens next to Mark Watney. The characters are sharply defined. You'll know who every one of them is, how they feel, etc. And it's hilarious, mostly due to Watney's combination of upbeat attitude and sarcasm. I literally laughed out loud many times reading this book. That doesn't usually happen with hard SF.<br/><br/>So if you love hard SF, this book is for you. If you're meh about hard SF, but you love a great story, characters, and humor, this book is also for you.</span>"

He needs to figure out how to survive. How to get or make food and water, and maybe dream of surviving. Our protagonist, Mark Watney the astronaut who's also a biologist and mechanical engineer, has no communication with Earth and NASA doesn't even know he's on alive, all alone on Mars.<br/><br/>The book is very entertaining, funny and witty.  Mark, the protagonist, is very intelligent but corky. He takes us through his experiences showing us what he's doing to survive and not go crazy every single day of his unplanned Martian vacation.  The book is 387 pages, the audio book is 11 hours and very well produced. The characters are entertaining and dramatized, the action and timing is fluid. I listened to the audio as a download from Audible.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2ENKYG0ZYQYLF?ASIN=1491590173	Broken toys and a drive to survive.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Mark Watney was a team member, but now he was alone.  Just him and the deserted equipment, all left behind by the Mars exploration team.  Does Mark spend his time hating, or does he shed all remorse and focus on his survival?  The options are his to peruse.<br/><br/>The crew, less one noteworthy character in his mind anyway, is in route to Earth.  The next Mars exploratory team is hundreds of days away from arrival.  How to survive must be Mark’s only concern?  Oh, and how to communicate with Earth for starters.  The terrible storm that drove them off the planet also destroyed key communications equipment.  Think Watney, you can do this!<br/><br/>The story moves quickly and interlaces Mark Watney’s journal into the fabric of the story, giving you both a view into his tenuous interactions with other people, and his personal coping process with himself.  What would you do so far from home, all alone with a pile of broken toys and your drive to survive?</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RUK4FHO5E2XX7?ASIN=1491590173	A Must for SciFi Fans	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">It is refreshing to finally read a *real* science fiction story. The Martian follows the classic motif of the marooned explorer/traveler. Mark Watney, thought to have died when a horrific dust storms puts a premature end to his crew's mission on Mars, chronicles his striving to survive the almost non-existent atmosphere and deadly cold temperatures.<br/>Mark Watney's logs show us a man who is resilient and resourceful. The humor and self-deprecations that surely mask fear, makes us smile and even chuckle as he works to survive and plan for his eventual (hopefully) rescue.<br/>*The Martian* is a page turner that keeps us holding our breath hoping that the author doesn't crush our hopes as we root for Watney, the crew of the Hermes, and. . . yes. . . NASA.<br/><br/>I have slogged through many science fiction tomes thinking there just *had* to be a jewel out there (oh, yes, I have read many a good story, too). *The Martian* is that jewel.</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R279XXVCBNIG2A?ASIN=1491590173	What a great tale!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">A fantastic read from the opening line to the final scene.  I am a great fan of dark humour and this story had lots! Thought provoking and an almost 100% believable story line.  I don't think I could ever hear a ""disco"" song again without recalling a part of this story - makes you look at potatoes in a new light as well!  Our hero, although a biologist by trade, can certainly turn his hand to just about anything and most of it without the help of the scientists on earth.  Goes to show what you can do when you have no other options and death is lurking just around the corner.  We were cheering him on whenever something went right and groaning in dismay when it didn't.<br/><br/>My partner is also reading this book and thoroughly enjoying it and he is not a sci-if fan.<br/><br/>Tried to find another book by this author but so far it looks like there is nothing else - what a pity.  Would love to see this book made into a movie.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1T35B7Q66AIUC?ASIN=1491590173	The Martian: Awesome!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Mark Watney was left for dead during a mission on the planet Mars. It was understandable, as all indications showed that he had to be dead. So, the mission was aborted, the crew evacuated, and Mark was the only human being left to survive on the deadly surface of Mars.<br/><br/>This book got my attention from the first sentence, and it never let go. As I grew to know the very real, very well-written main character, Mark Watney, I grew to treasure his wonderful sense of humor and his never-give-up attitude.<br/><br/>This book works on so many, many levels. It is probably one of the most intense and exciting adventures I have ever read. Every page held my rapt attention. I could not turn the pages fast enough! This book also demonstrates a strong belief in the power of optimism and in the conviction that people are intrinsically altruistic. This is one unforgettable book! Wish I could give it six stars!</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2KR82WBSN1WGA?ASIN=1491590173	A worth reading	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Simple put: this book is wonderful. It is a must for anyone that enjoy dream with manned missions to Mars. Clear and well crafted, this book show us what the life can be on such extreme situation. In the same line of Mars Trilogy (Kim Stanley Robinson, 2009) here the author spare a long time in details about the technology and science background required to bring credibility to his adventure.<br/><br/>Been a sci-fi story, one cannot expect too much about complex character development and this book not provide it. Mark Watney is a eternal calm, logical, well trained astronaut that always do what he need to do without fall in despair or stress even when he is left alone in Mars for about two years. However good sci-fi (good hard sci-fi in fact) is all about credible science foundation and not too much about anything else. In this regard The Martian is without doubt a very good hard-like-rock sci-fi story.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2JIM0TKHD9TX6?ASIN=1491590173	Bet you can't put this one down!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">One of the best stories I've read - believeable, realisitic, and you keep wondering how Mark can survive.  Never would have thought that a story based on a journal would be intense and gripping, but the author has worked wonders -- I had a hard time putting this book down!  The reader gets a very in depth look at the stranded astronaut, how he grappled with his many survival challenges and overcame each one in turn.<br/><br/>At the end of the book the only disappointment I felt is that I realized that we hadn't learned anything about the other aspects of the astronaut's life -- family, love interests, etc.  And I also wonder how he readjusted to life on earth after a prolonged exposure to daily dances with death not to mention the isolation.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!  The reader doesn't have to suspend disbelief or accept any premise that seems unbased on science -- just dive in and hang on tight.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R2S7Y7TSZMG8AA?ASIN=1491590173	extremely interesting	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I really like this story because it's so simple, so few characters (mostly one) and yet, so many details, problems and things are happening! There are almost no boring parts at all! you can't leave the book alone. Just can't. Mark Watney is one damn interesting character, and fun to read about! (Although I do find myself wondering how the hell he got the job, from the s*** he's saying..)<br/><br/>I would say it's not a book for everyone. more of a book for people who knows a thing or two about physics and chemistry, or else they would just find the book full of information they are clueless about and a bit too technical. But mind you, it's supposed to be written from the point of view of an Astronaut...they are smart people.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this to every person with a curious mind who could appropriate the many fine details which make the story so damn good. Well done!</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R344VQ7UKRE9OK?ASIN=1491590173	Alone on Mars with Overly-Jokey Guy	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">On the pro side, this is a fantastic premise with tremendous potential, and based on the favorable reviews it's clear that to most readers that potential was reached.  I love ""protagonist alone against the elements"" stories, and this one breaks new ground by offering a somewhat plausible scenario of survival on a distant planet using slightly beyond modern technology.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, on the con side, the main character (Mark Watney) has a persistent tendency to make a joke out of everything, which serves to diffuse any real tension that's at the core of most survival stories.  His log entries in exacting technical detail are punctuated with punch lines and already dated phrases like ""Just sayin"".  At times his narratives read like setups for internet comment box zingers, all of which manages to transform the character from sympathetic to smug.<br/><br/>We all know fun-loving jokesters, but usually in most social settings there are at least some personalities that have little patience for these types.  Not here.  The protagonist is universally revered by everyone, even his crew-mates who spent years at a time with him and apparently never tired of his witty quips.  Here's one telling exchange as they watch events unfold from a distance:  ""It'll take a miracle. Do you believe in God?"" ... ""I believe in Mark Watney.""<br/><br/>Obviously I'm in the minority here, but I wish I could say the same.</span>"
4.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3HEGJBD03VUZA?ASIN=1491590173	First Class	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I have been reading SF since the 1950s and have a fair idea of what I like - and really, I had thought I was a bit zoned out with near space adventure.  I was wrong.  I dont know what made me buy this book, but it took my attention from the first page and kept it throughout.  Others have mentioned the expletives saying they were excessive.  Obviously they havn't worked out there in the real world.  After working on a main-line gang in the electrical industry, I found the language in the book is mild and minimal - and I have to say, exactly what I would be using in similar circumstances.<br/>The science was plausible to me as a reasonably well-read layman, whether it would work out in real life I dont know, but really, it doesnt have to - Its a story. A good story with humour and a bit of suspense.<br/>I am somewhat bemused, as I never thought I would give any story 5 stars, but there it is!</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3I8IZ8NUQWIRT?ASIN=1491590173	O  Sol O Me, Oh!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I wanted to like this book because I like science fiction. This is not science fiction. It is a manual on how to survive on Mars. The accolades for this book are sung by other science fiction writers who line up behind Andy Weir out of some strange team loyalty. I don't buy it. Occasionally, the story  creates some necessary drama through obvious moral contrivances relative to other characters, but not enough to bring the tension one needs in basic storytelling. Page after page of blandly written explanations of things so technically irrelevant to any reader (except those who work in this technology), ""The Martian"" reads like a forensic diary--all facts, no literary attempt to scaffold interior character dimensions or utilize basic imagery of any kind to color the narrative. All characters in this book suffer from superficial constructions that paper over the kinds of humanity that inform the terror of isolation. With main character Mark Watney's ability to solve just about any problem, at no moment did I feel he was in any real danger.  Problems arise, solutions are cobbled together in a way that subtracts the reader from crisis points. I could skip over pages of Watney journal entries and have no problem reconnecting with the very thin plot, which was only energized when scenes shifted to Ground Control. And everything there was typical gung-ho, ""We're coming to getcha!"" bathos.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3AXITT2F2ARBA?ASIN=1491590173	Great  SciFi entertainment....	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">One of the better SciFi stories I've read recently ... and a hoot to read, as well.  I'm certainly not a NASA science expert, but it all sounded darned accurate - or sufficiently accurate enough to be very entertaining, and definitely all I need in a fast book.  Sometimes tense, believeable and fast moving, and occasionally even funny to the point that it brought me to tears... No doubt one of the few times I've actually broken out in a loud guffaw while I read (my wife actually wanted to know what was so hilarious)..<br/>While, yes, it does have a bit of 'gritty' language, no doubt in any similar REAL circumstance a lot worse would be heard, unintentionally or not, but a darned good story, nonetheless - and I've most assuredly paid many times the cost of this for much less entertaining reads.<br/>I'd recommend it to anyone like myself who enjoys the 'escapism' of believable SciFi.</span>"
2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/RX6ZVUPS1570U?ASIN=1491590173	didnt do it for me	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I liked the concept of being left on a planet alone but didn't like the endless details of making what materials he had available into items he needed.  I was hoping for the garden soil to turn into Martian life.  The humor was good.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R3FV8DB5MFBXGS?ASIN=1491590173	No Dust Storms On Mars	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">It's a well done book, but unlike the other Hard Sci-Fi devotees that review this book, I have to subtract a star because the premise is just not possible. The whole book is predicated on this poor guy being left behind because of a dust-storm on Mars. As any high-school student can tell you, that is simply not possible on Mars. No dust storms, no storms at all. No dust at all. The amount of wind you would feel on Mars would be the equivalent of the amount of wind you feel in your living room with all the doors and windows closed. You might feel a faint bit from the A/C but all in all there is just no possible way that the atmosphere of Mars can generate wind. Not possible. So except for that little problem, we are good to go. If there was some believable way to have him left behind, even something that requires a suspension of disbelief, that would be better than the impossible.</span>"
2.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R34PPCQEMBDXC3?ASIN=1491590173	Since When was Science Fiction Funny Too?	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">Mark Whatney is one of six astronauts on the third manned mission to Mars. When a violent windstorm arises and they are forced to abort the mission, Whatney is struck by a loose satellite dish and presumed dead. But he isn't, and the crew leaves him behind on Mars in ignorance. He is then forced to assess his situation and do everything he can to survive until he can alert NASA and formulate a rescue plan.<br/><br/>I loved this book! The story is plausible and based heavily on science, but it is a presented in a way that a layman can understand and become invested in. Although I believed I could guess the ending, I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen. I read late into the night and carry the book around the house with me in case I could sneak in a few pages while cooking dinner or during commercials when I watched TV. The short snippets made this very easy to do. Aside from the exciting story, this story is great because of the characters. Weir's diverse cast of characters are excellent and memorable, especially Whatney who gets so many great lines, I can't even quote them all. I got one of the biggest chuckles from this one: ""If ruining the only religious icon I have leaves me vulnerable to Martian vampires, I'll have to risk it.""<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this one highly enough. Sci-fi geeks and casual readers alike will find it hard to put down.</span>"
3.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1LRNWBOMIWCCV?ASIN=1491590173	Great Read	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This is a great story and great writing. I also followed the serial version. Witty and clever, I highly recommend it for a bit of sci-fi escapism.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R347DYGQQO67AJ?ASIN=1491590173	What?! Did that really happen?	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">YES IT REALLY HAPPENED! This book is outstanding. It's the best novel I've read this year (besides Hugh Howey's WOOL series). It gripped me from the first couple pages and didn't let go. I won't be surprised when this book keeps sneaking its way up the Amazon charts like it has been doing for the last week or so. I can't recommend this book enough, and for $.99 it's a steal. I'm not sure the author realized it was going to be this popular when he threw it up on Amazon, boy, he's going to be surprised when we see this thing in the top 200. It would make an excellent movie too. I just recommend it to my brother and he's already loving it. When I was at work, I was literally counting down the hours till I could run home and keep reading. I love the new age of self-publishing, you never know what you're going to find.<br/>Buy this book now, you definitely won't regret it.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1NLT7A3BVX12A?ASIN=1491590173	Great Science, Weak Everything Else	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This novel has gotten overwhelmingly positive reviews, but for me it was less than stellar.<br/>OK, maybe I should restate that.<br/>This is a wonderful novel for a certain kind of reader. I am not that reader.<br/>Watching a brilliant, witty engineer get trapped on Mars and struggle to work with the available resources is interesting for about 50 pages. But by page 51, I was hungry for more complexity--not the technical kind, there's plenty of that, but the emotional kind. I wanted to know how it felt to be the only person on a desolate planet. What did he miss the most about Earth? How did the experience change him? I also wanted to be able to more effectively imagine myself there on Mars. What does the sun look like? How does your breath sound? Is there a horizon line?<br/>As a result of too much time spent on technology-related details and not enough on emotional and physical ones, I often felt distant from the action.<br/>Another problem I had was the overly-simplistic characters. While sci-fi novels aren't known for their highly nuanced portrayals, these people were painted with such a broad brush they were really just stick figures.<br/>The thousands of five star reviews tell me that I'm clearly not The Martian's demographic. But even with that in mind, I believe if Weir had worked with a good editor, he would have produced a much better book.</span>"
5.0	/gp/customer-reviews/R1RY6RD8DKKE4H?ASIN=1491590173	Where There's a Will...	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I always liked books reveling in the heroism of the human spirit.  I also enjoy reading about science, space and technology.  So this novel was near perfection - it rings so authentic and keeps the reader so enthralled. I truly have problems finding anything to criticize.  It's all there - plot, characters, setting, suspense, technology, problem solving, puzzles.  Many have criticized the heavy tech talk but they fail to recognize that this is EXACTLY how a trained astronaut would think and act.<br/><br/>Praise should be extended for the manner in which he made one character interesting for hundreds of pages.  And he did so without resorting to aliens, hidden Martians, supernatural devices or magic.  Incredible ending - just loved it.  I can't wait for Mr. Weir's next book although I find it difficult to imagine he can top this one.</span>"
